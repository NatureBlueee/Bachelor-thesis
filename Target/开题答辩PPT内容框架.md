Title: The Impact of AI Literacy on Upward Influence Behavior among Generation Z Employees: A Resource Dependence Perspective

 Overall Style

 Visual Style: "Academic Tech"

The visual style should embody an "Academic Tech" aesthetic that bridges professional rigor with digital innovation. The design needs to feel structured and authoritative to reflect the theoretical foundations, while incorporating fluid and energetic accents to represent the AI context.

The color palette should rely on a deep midnight blue base for professionalism, using electric teal or cyan sparingly to highlight key AI elements and data. Layouts must prioritize extreme simplicity with generous white space, strictly adhering to a one-idea-per-slide principle. Visuals should be clean and geometric, avoiding decorative clutter and focusing attention solely on critical data points. Typography should remain clean, modern, and highly readable throughout.

 Slide 2: Research Background

The rapid advancement of AI technologies has transformed the modern workplace. A distinctive feature is the generational asymmetry in AI competence. Generation Z employees often possess superior AI skills compared to their supervisors, creating an interesting power dynamic.

KEY DATA:
- 86% of employers expect AI to transform their business by 2030 (WEF 2025)
- Employees use AI at a rate 3.25x higher than leaders estimate (McKinsey 2025)
- 59% of Gen Z actively coach older colleagues on AI tools (IWG 2025)

This phenomenon challenges conventional leadership models and raises questions about how AI literacy translates into organizational influence.

 Slide 3: Research Question and Objectives

Core Question: When young employees possess AI skills their supervisors lack, can they use these competencies to influence organizational decisions?

Objectives:
1. Explore how AI literacy enables Gen Z employees to engage in upward influence behavior
2. Investigate perceived resource advantage as the psychological mechanism
3. Examine supervisor openness as the moderating factor
4. Provide theoretical insights grounded in Resource Dependence Theory

---

 Slide 4: Theoretical Foundation

Core Theory: Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978)

Those who control scarce and valuable resources hold power over those who need them.

Theoretical Evolution:
- 1978: RDT for inter-organizational power
- 2021: Tripathi extended RDT to employee-supervisor relationships
- This Study: AI literacy as the specific scarce resource

---

 Slide 5: Research Model

Four Variables:
1. AI Literacy (IV): AI knowledge, affectivity, thinking (Zhong et al. 2024)
2. Perceived Resource Advantage (Mediator): Subjective perception of holding resources supervisors need but lack
3. Upward Influence Behavior (DV): Idea generation, promotion, implementation
4. Supervisor Openness (Moderator): Receptiveness to subordinate input

Propositions:
- P1: AI Literacy leads to Perceived Resource Advantage
- P2: Perceived Resource Advantage enables Upward Influence Behavior
- P3: Mediation effect through Perceived Resource Advantage
- P4: Supervisor Openness moderates the relationship

---

 Slide 6: Methodology

Approach: Qualitative research using semi-structured interviews

Sample: 15-20 Gen Z knowledge workers
- Born 1995-2010
- Minimum 6 months work experience
- Regular AI tool users

Analysis: Thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke (2006)

Justification: The phenomenon is novel and requires understanding how the relationship operates, not just whether it exists.

 Slide 7: Significance

Theoretical Contributions:
- Extends RDT to employee-supervisor dyad with AI literacy as the resource
- Explores AI literacy outcomes beyond educational settings
- Identifies AI literacy as novel antecedent of upward influence

Practical Implications:
- Inform talent development and succession planning
- Guide intergenerational collaboration in AI-driven organizations
- Help Gen Z convert AI skills into career capital
