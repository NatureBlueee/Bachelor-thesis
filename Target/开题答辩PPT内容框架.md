## Slide 2: Research Background - The Rise of AI

**Section 1.1.1 from Thesis**

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, exemplified by the emergence of ChatGPT, Claude, and other generative AI tools, has fundamentally transformed the modern workplace. Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, AI-powered tools have been rapidly adopted across industries.

**Key Industry Data**:
- 92% of companies plan to increase their AI investments over the next three years (McKinsey, 2025)
- 92% of Fortune 500 companies already have employees actively using ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025)
- Over 70% of employees believe that AI will change more than 30% of their work within two years (McKinsey, 2025)

In China, the national "AI+" strategy has further accelerated the integration of AI into organizational processes, positioning AI literacy as an increasingly critical competency for employees in the digital economy.

## Slide 3: Research Background - Generational Asymmetry

**Section 1.1.2 from Thesis**

A distinctive feature of the current AI revolution is the generational asymmetry in technological competence. Generation Z employees, typically defined as those born between 1995 and 2010, have grown up immersed in digital technologies and are often characterized as "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001).

**Key Industry Data**:
- 80% of Gen Z employees (aged 18-24) report feeling comfortable using gen AI at work, significantly higher than older cohorts (McKinsey, 2025)
- 57% of Gen Z employees use generative AI in their daily work (Deloitte, 2025 survey of 23,000+ respondents across 44 countries)
- 70% of Gen Z actively invest time to develop AI-related skills (Deloitte, 2025)
- 59% of Gen Z employees are actively coaching older colleagues on how to use AI tools (IWG, 2025)
- Employees aged 35-44 (core millennials, often in managerial roles) exhibit even higher comfort levels at 90% (McKinsey, 2025)

This creates an interesting power dynamic: while managers typically hold formal authority and institutional knowledge, younger employees may possess superior AI skills that are increasingly valuable in the workplace.

## Slide 4: Research Background - Shifting Power Dynamics

**Section 1.1.3 from Thesis**

According to Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), power in organizations derives from the control of scarce and valuable resources. When Generation Z employees possess AI skills that their supervisors lack, they may acquire a form of resource-based power that enables them to exert upward influence on their managers.

**Key Industry Data - The Perception Gap**:
- Employees are using AI for more than 30% of their daily tasks at a rate **3.25 times higher** than their C-suite leaders estimate (13% vs. 4%) — McKinsey Superagency, 2025
- This "invisible" adoption creates a form of information asymmetry where subordinates hold resources that supervisors may not even be aware of
- 47% of C-suite executives express frustration that their companies are developing gen AI tools too slowly
- 2.4 times more leaders cite "employee readiness" as an adoption barrier compared to employees themselves — despite employees already using AI at rates far exceeding expectations

This phenomenon challenges conventional top-down leadership models and raises important questions about how AI literacy translates into organizational influence.

## Slide 5: Research Background - The Chinese Context

**Section 1.1.4 from Thesis**

The Chinese organizational context presents unique characteristics:
- China's high power distance culture (Hofstede, 2001) traditionally emphasizes hierarchical relationships and deference to authority
- The rapid pace of digital transformation in Chinese organizations, combined with the large proportion of Generation Z entering the workforce, creates tensions between traditional power structures and emerging technology-driven influence patterns

Understanding how AI literacy enables upward influence in this context can provide valuable insights for both theory and practice.

---

## Slide 6: Core Research Question

**Central Question**:  
When young employees possess AI skills that their supervisors lack, can they use these competencies to influence organizational decisions?

**Research Objectives** (Section 1.2 from Thesis):

1. Explore how AI literacy enables Generation Z employees to engage in upward influence behavior in the workplace, identifying the specific mechanisms and processes involved.

2. Investigate the role of perceived resource advantage as a psychological mechanism linking AI literacy to upward influence behavior.

3. Examine how supervisor openness moderates the relationship between AI literacy and upward influence behavior.

4. Provide theoretical insights grounded in Resource Dependence Theory and practical recommendations for talent management and intergenerational collaboration in AI-driven organizations.

## Slide 7: Theoretical Foundation

**Core Theory: Resource Dependence Theory (RDT)**

Original Formulation: Pfeffer & Salancik (1978)
- Core principle: "Those who control scarce, valuable resources hold power over those who need them"
- Originally applied to inter-organizational relationships

**Theoretical Evolution**:
- 1978: Pfeffer & Salancik — RDT for inter-organizational power
- 2021: Tripathi (Frontiers in Psychology) — Extended RDT to employee-supervisor relationships; proposed that employees holding "tacit resources" can exert upward influence
- 2024/This Study: AI literacy as the specific scarce resource that creates new power dynamics

**Key Insight**: AI Literacy = Scarce Resource = Power Base

---

## Slide 8: Research Model (Core Slide)

**Four Variables and Their Relationships**:

1. **AI Literacy (Independent Variable)**
   - Definition: Zhong et al. (2024) three-dimensional framework
   - Dimensions: AI Knowledge, AI Affectivity, AI Thinking

2. **Perceived Resource Advantage (Mediator)**
   - Definition: Employees' subjective perception that they hold AI-related resources that their supervisors need but lack
   - Key insight: Objective skills ≠ Power; Subjective perception = Power

3. **Upward Influence Behavior (Dependent Variable)**
   - Definition: Adapted from Scott & Bruce (1994)
   - Three stages: Idea Generation → Idea Promotion → Idea Implementation

4. **Supervisor Openness (Moderator)**
   - Definition: The extent to which supervisors are receptive to employee input and new ideas (Detert & Burris, 2007)
   - Critical boundary condition, especially in high power distance cultures

**Research Propositions**:
- P1: AI Literacy → Perceived Resource Advantage (grounded in RDT)
- P2: Perceived Resource Advantage → Upward Influence Behavior (grounded in Social Cognitive Theory)
- P3: Perceived Resource Advantage mediates the AI Literacy → Upward Influence relationship
- P4: Supervisor Openness moderates the Perceived Resource Advantage → Upward Influence relationship

---

## Slide 9: Variable Definitions

**AI Literacy** (Zhong et al., 2024):
- AI Knowledge: Understanding AI concepts, capabilities, and limitations
- AI Affectivity: Attitudes, confidence, and emotional responses toward AI
- AI Thinking: Ability to think with and through AI to solve problems

**Perceived Resource Advantage**:
- Subjective perception: "I possess something my supervisor needs but lacks"
- This psychological mechanism transforms objective competencies into behavioral motivation

**Upward Influence Behavior** (adapted from Scott & Bruce, 1994):
- Idea Generation: Identifying opportunities where AI can improve work
- Idea Promotion: Persuading supervisors to adopt AI-related suggestions
- Idea Implementation: Actively participating in executing approved changes

**Supervisor Openness** (Detert & Burris, 2007):
- Receptiveness to subordinate input
- Openness to new technologies and ideas from younger employees

## Slide 10: Research Methodology

**Approach**: Qualitative Research — Semi-structured In-depth Interviews

**Justification for Qualitative Method**:
1. The phenomenon is novel (ChatGPT released only ~2 years ago)
2. Need to understand "how" the relationship operates, not just "whether" it exists
3. No mature quantitative scales exist for this specific phenomenon
4. Exploratory research to build foundation for future quantitative studies

**Sample**:
- 15-20 Generation Z knowledge workers
- Born 1995-2010
- Minimum 6 months full-time work experience
- Regular users of AI tools in their work
- Purposive and snowball sampling

**Data Analysis**:
- Thematic Analysis following Braun & Clarke (2006) six-step process:
  1. Familiarization with data
  2. Initial coding
  3. Searching for themes
  4. Reviewing themes
  5. Defining and naming themes
  6. Writing the report

## Slide 11: Research Significance

**Theoretical Contributions** (Section 1.3.1 from Thesis):

1. Extends Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) to the employee-supervisor dyad by examining AI literacy as a form of firm-specific human capital that creates dependency relationships enabling upward influence.

2. Contributes to AI literacy literature by exploring organizational behavior outcomes beyond educational settings — specifically power, influence, and leadership dynamics.

3. Advances upward influence literature by identifying AI literacy as a novel antecedent of influence behavior in the context of generational dynamics and digital transformation.

**Practical Implications** (Section 1.3.2 from Thesis):

- For HR managers: Inform talent development strategies and succession planning
- For organizational leaders: Guide creation of cultures leveraging AI competencies of younger employees while maintaining intergenerational collaboration
- For Gen Z employees: Understand how to strategically convert AI skills into career capital
- For Chinese organizations: Manage transition to AI-driven work while respecting cultural norms around hierarchy
