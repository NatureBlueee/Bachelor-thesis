## I. Research Background and Significance

### The Unusual Revolution

ChatGPT was released less than two years ago. In that brief window, generative AI has morphed from a tech-insider talking point into workplace infrastructure. Yet what makes this wave unusual is not its speed—it is who holds the keys.

Consider the previous technological revolutions: telephone, personal computer, internet. Senior employees might have adapted more slowly, but diffusion was invariably top-down. Managers led; the young followed. Generative AI flips this. Entry-level Gen Z employees routinely outpace their supervisors in fluency.

The numbers are striking. Deloitte (2025) reports that 57% of Gen Z workers use generative AI daily—a rate that dwarfs older cohorts. IWG (2025) finds that 59% of Gen Z employees have "reverse-coached" senior colleagues on technology. Meanwhile, McKinsey (2025) notes that executives underestimate their teams' actual AI usage by a factor of 3.25. When perception lags reality by this much, organizations are only beginning to reckon with what AI competence means for internal power dynamics.

This is not merely about a new tool. It is about a production paradigm in transformation—work processes reshaped at the root. When employees leverage AI to compress tasks that once took days into hours, the very meaning of "expertise" undergoes quiet redefinition.

### Why Gen Z? Why Upward Influence?

Gen Z (born 1995-2010) is distinctive beyond digital fluency. Schroth (2019) documents that this cohort's psychological contract differs markedly from predecessors: for them, "having ideas valued" is not a perk but a baseline expectation—being unheard equates to being disrespected. They are achievement-oriented, prioritize autonomy, resist purely transactional employment relationships. What they lack in tenure they often compensate in technological agility (Zahra et al., 2025).

AI literacy, then, represents a resource that inverts the usual experience-based hierarchy: the newcomers possess something the organization desperately needs.

Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer et al., 1978) holds that power flows toward those who control resources others need. Tripathi (2021) extended this lens to the employee-supervisor dyad, demonstrating that employees can leverage tacit resources—what he calls "hosts of tacit resources"—to influence superiors. The present study extends this logic into an AI context: when Gen Z employees possess AI competencies the organization requires, a peculiar power asymmetry emerges. At least in this domain, the newcomer becomes the resource holder.

Yet possessing a resource and wielding influence are not the same. DeRue et al. (2010) offer a useful micro-mechanism through their leadership identity construction framework: employees must *claim* expertise, and supervisors must *grant* recognition. Upward influence, through this lens, is not simply about skill—it is about identity negotiation. A Gen Z employee's AI-informed suggestions are, in essence, *claims* to situational leadership in the AI domain. Whether such claims succeed depends heavily on the supervisor's schema: those embracing shared leadership (high openness) may welcome these claims; those holding hierarchical schemas may resist.

### Research Gap

Despite growing interest in AI literacy and generational dynamics, prior research has largely failed to connect these strands. Studies on AI-related employee attitudes tend to focus on AI anxiety or acceptance—framing that presumes employees still choose whether to use AI. But as AI becomes ubiquitous, the question shifts from "whether to adopt" to "what happens once adoption is given." Generation-focused studies often remain descriptive, cataloguing Millennial or Gen Z traits without probing behavioral outcomes in supervisor relationships (Zahra et al., 2025). The intersection of AI literacy, Gen Z's distinctive psychological contract, and upward influence behavior remains underexplored—particularly in high-power-distance contexts such as China (Hofstede, 2001), where subordinate initiative is culturally constrained yet increasingly organizationally valued (Chen et al., 2013).

### Research Questions

This study addresses three interrelated questions:

- **RQ1**: How do Generation Z employees perceive and develop their AI literacy in workplace contexts?
- **RQ2**: How does AI literacy influence Generation Z employees' upward influence behaviors toward their supervisors?
- **RQ3**: What role does supervisor openness play in facilitating or constraining AI-informed upward influence?

### Significance

**Theoretical contributions.** This study extends Resource Dependence Theory's analytical unit from inter-organizational relations to the supervisor-subordinate dyad, illuminating the micro-processes through which AI competence reshapes workplace power dynamics. By integrating Leadership Identity Construction Theory (DeRue et al., 2010), it offers a mechanism—claiming and granting—that operationalizes how resources translate (or fail to translate) into influence.

**Practical implications.** For organizations navigating digital transformation, understanding how to unlock young employees' AI-enabled potential—rather than suppress or ignore it—becomes a strategic imperative. The findings will inform leadership development, intergenerational collaboration, and talent management in AI-intensive environments.

## II. Research Content and Methods

### 2.1 Theoretical Framework

This study approaches theory not as propositions awaiting verification, but as interpretive lenses that sensitize the researcher to particular dynamics. The primary frameworks include:

| Theory | Role in This Study | Key References |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Resource Dependence Theory** | Macro-logic: explains why AI literacy constitutes a power resource | Pfeffer et al., 1978; Tripathi, 2021 |
| **Leadership Identity Construction** | Micro-mechanism: explains how influence unfolds through claiming-granting | DeRue et al., 2010 |
| **AI Literacy Framework** | Variable definition: specifies what AI literacy encompasses | Zhong et al., 2024; Ng et al., 2023 |
| **Social Cognitive Theory** | Mediating logic: explains how objective capability becomes perceived advantage | Bandura, 1997 |

Unlike confirmatory studies testing predefined hypotheses, this exploratory investigation allows themes to emerge from data. The theoretical frameworks above inform—but do not constrain—interpretation.

### 2.2 Research Design

| Dimension | Choice |
|-----------|--------|
| Paradigm | Interpretivism |
| Approach | Exploratory qualitative research |
| Data collection | Semi-structured in-depth interviews |
| Analysis | Thematic analysis (Braun et al., 2006) |

### 2.3 Sample Criteria

| Criterion | Requirement | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Generation | Born 1995-2010 (Gen Z) | Focus on digital natives |
| Work experience | ≥6 months full-time | Ensures sufficient workplace exposure |
| AI usage | Regular AI tool use at work | Ensures research relevance |
| Work type | Knowledge work | AI literacy most salient in cognitive tasks |

Sample size: 15-20 participants, targeting theoretical saturation (Guest et al., 2020).

### 2.4 Data Analysis: Six-Phase Thematic Analysis

Following Braun et al. (2006):

1. **Familiarization**: Repeated reading of transcripts
2. **Initial coding**: Systematic identification of meaningful segments
3. **Theme searching**: Organizing codes into broader themes
4. **Theme reviewing**: Checking coherence with data
5. **Defining themes**: Articulating the essence of each theme
6. **Report production**: Weaving themes into a narrative addressing RQs

### 2.5 Trustworthiness

| Criterion | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Credibility | Member checking; peer debriefing |
| Transferability | Thick description of context |
| Dependability | Audit trail |
| Confirmability | Reflexive journaling |
