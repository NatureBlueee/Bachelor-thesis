## I. Research Background and Significance

### Ⅰ. Research Background

ChatGPT was released less than two years ago. In that brief window, generative AI has morphed from a tech-insider talking point into workplace infrastructure. Yet what makes this wave unusual is not its speed—it is who holds the keys.

Consider the previous technological revolutions: telephone, personal computer, internet. Senior employees might have adapted more slowly, but diffusion was invariably top-down. Managers led; the young followed. Generative AI flips this pattern—not because younger employees are inherently smarter, but because they happened to be the ones immersed in the technology as it matured.

When a field changes as fast as AI has—GPQA scores doubling in two years, code agents jumping from 12% to 77% on research-level tasks—the workforce that grew up inside this acceleration carries a different relationship to it than those watching from outside. Generation Z employees are not merely "digital natives" in the passive sense of having seen screens since childhood. They are practitioners: 57% use generative AI daily, 70% invest weekly time in building AI skills, and 59% report coaching older colleagues on AI use (Deloitte, 2025; IWG, 2025). When organizations plan to increase AI investments—92% intend to do so (McKinsey, 2025)—these employees hold what the organization needs.

AI literacy, then, represents a resource that inverts the usual experience-based hierarchy: the newcomers possess something the organization desperately needs. Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer et al., 1978) suggests that power flows toward those who control resources others need. Yet possessing a resource and wielding influence are not the same. DeRue et al. (2010) offer a mechanism: employees must *claim* expertise, and supervisors must *grant* recognition. Whether such claims succeed depends on the supervisor's openness to shared leadership.

### Ⅱ. Research Objective

This study aims to:

(1) Explore how Generation Z employees perceive and develop their AI literacy in workplace contexts.

(2) Analyze how AI literacy influences Generation Z employees' upward influence behaviors toward supervisors.

(3) Examine the role of supervisor openness in facilitating or constraining AI-informed upward influence.

(4) Provide practical insights for organizations seeking to leverage young employees' AI competencies.

### Ⅲ. Research Significance

**Theoretical contributions.** This study extends Resource Dependence Theory's analytical unit from inter-organizational relations to the supervisor-subordinate dyad, illuminating how AI competence reshapes workplace power dynamics. By integrating Leadership Identity Construction Theory (DeRue et al., 2010), it offers a mechanism—claiming and granting—that explains how resources translate (or fail to translate) into influence.

**Practical implications.** For organizations navigating digital transformation, understanding how to unlock young employees' AI-enabled potential—rather than suppress or ignore it—becomes a strategic imperative. The findings will inform leadership development, intergenerational collaboration, and talent management.

### Ⅳ. Research Review

**AI Literacy Research.** AI literacy has been conceptualized as a multidimensional construct encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions (Ng et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2024). However, most studies focus on educational contexts rather than workplace applications (Cetindamar et al., 2022).

**Generation Z in the Workplace.** Gen Z (born 1995-2010) differs from predecessors in their psychological contract: "having ideas valued" is a baseline expectation, not a perk (Schroth, 2019). They prioritize autonomy, resist purely transactional employment relationships, and compensate for lack of tenure with technological agility (Zahra et al., 2025).

**Upward Influence Behavior.** Prior research on upward influence has focused on tactics such as rationality, ingratiation, and coalition-building (Kipnis et al., 1980). However, the role of technological competence as a power resource remains underexplored.

**Research Gap.** Most AI-related employee research adopts a threat-oriented lens, focusing on anxiety and job displacement fears. Studies published in 2023 tested models scoring 39% on GPQA Diamond and 12% on FrontierScience; by December 2025, scores reached 93% and 77%. Conclusions drawn from the GPT-4 era may not transfer to the GPT-5.2/Claude Opus 4.5 era. The intersection of AI literacy, Gen Z's psychological contract, and upward influence remains underexplored—particularly in high-power-distance contexts such as China (Hofstede, 2001; Chen et al., 2013).

This study adopts an **exploratory qualitative approach** using semi-structured in-depth interviews. Qualitative methods are appropriate because the intersection of AI literacy and upward influence is underexplored, requiring discovery of emergent themes rather than hypothesis testing.

**Sample:** 15-20 Gen Z employees (born 1995-2010) with ≥6 months full-time work experience and regular AI tool use in knowledge work contexts.

**Analysis:** Six-phase thematic analysis (Braun et al., 2006), allowing themes to emerge from data while informed by theoretical sensitizing concepts.
