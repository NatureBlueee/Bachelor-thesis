AI素养对Z世代员工向上影响行为的影响：资源依赖视角

$$张晨曦$$

ChatGPT公开发布不过两年，生成式AI已从技术圈的谈资变成职场的基础设施。但这场变革真正不寻常的地方，不在于速度——而在于谁掌握了钥匙。

回顾此前的技术浪潮——电话、计算机、互联网——资深员工或许适应得慢一些，但新技术在组织中的扩散几乎都是自上而下的：管理层主导，年轻人跟随。生成式AI却把这个模式翻转了过来。在各个行业，刚入职的Z世代员工往往比他们的上级更熟练地使用这些工具。调研数据印证了这一点：57%的Z世代员工每天使用生成式AI，59%正在"反向辅导"年长同事（Deloitte, 2025; IWG, 2025）。与此同时，高管对团队AI使用程度的估计，比实际情况低了3.25倍（McKinsey, 2025）。

这意味着什么？资源依赖理论告诉我们，权力流向那些控制着他人所需资源的人。当年轻员工拥有上级缺乏的AI素养，一种不寻常的动态便浮现了：传统的上下级资源不对称——至少在这一领域——开始向新人倾斜。但这种资源优势会转化为实际影响力吗？在什么条件下？通过什么机制？

本研究正是围绕这一问题展开。我采用定性方法，通过对15-20名在工作中使用AI的Z世代知识型员工进行深度访谈，探索AI素养如何转化为向上影响行为。研究聚焦于"感知资源优势"这一中介机制——即员工对"我有上司需要的东西"这一认知——并考察上级开放性作为边界条件的调节作用。

研究的理论贡献在于将资源依赖理论的分析单元从组织间下沉到上下级关系层面，揭示AI时代职场权力动态重构的微观过程。实践层面，研究将为组织如何激活年轻员工的AI赋能潜力、促进代际知识双向流动提供依据。

ABSTRACT

The Impact of AI Literacy on Upward Influence Behavior among Generation Z Employees: A Resource Dependence Perspective

$$Student Name$$

Barely two years after ChatGPT's public release, generative AI has ceased to be a curiosity and become infrastructure. What makes this wave of technological change unusual, however, is not its speed—it is who holds the keys.

In most previous technology revolutions—telephones, personal computers, the internet—senior employees may have lagged in adoption, but the organizational rollout was invariably top-down: management led, and the young followed. Generative AI has inverted this pattern. Across industries, newly hired Generation Z employees often wield these tools more fluently than their supervisors do. Survey data bears this out: 57% of Gen Z workers use generative AI daily, and 59% report "reverse-mentoring" older colleagues on how to use it (Deloitte, 2025; IWG, 2025). Meanwhile, executives underestimate the extent of AI use among their teams by a factor of 3.25 (McKinsey, 2025).

This matters because, as Resource Dependence Theory tells us, power flows to those who control resources others need. When young employees possess AI competencies their managers lack, an unfamiliar dynamic emerges: the traditional resource asymmetry between supervisor and subordinate tilts—at least in this domain—in favor of the newcomer. Does that translate into actual influence? Under what conditions? And through what mechanisms?

This study investigates precisely these questions. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 15–20 Generation Z knowledge workers in China, I explore how AI literacy enables upward influence behavior. I focus on *perceived resource advantage*—the employee's subjective awareness that "I have something my boss needs"—as a mediating mechanism, and *supervisor openness* as a boundary condition that determines whether resource advantage converts into voice.

Theoretically, the study extends Resource Dependence Theory downward: from inter-organizational relations to the supervisor-subordinate dyad. Practically, it offers evidence-based guidance on how organizations might unlock the AI-enabled potential of young employees and facilitate bidirectional intergenerational knowledge transfer.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION

1.1 Research Background

Barely two years after ChatGPT's public release, generative AI is no longer the province of technologists—it is workplace infrastructure. Ninety-two percent of companies plan to increase their AI investments over the next three years (McKinsey, 2025); 92% of Fortune 500 firms already have employees using ChatGPT in their daily work (OpenAI, 2025). More than 70% of employees believe AI will transform over 30% of their tasks within two years (McKinsey, 2025).

What makes this transformation remarkable is not its speed—rapid adoption is, by now, expected. What is remarkable is *who is leading it*. In prior technology revolutions, organizational adoption was invariably top-down: management directed, and junior employees followed. Generative AI has inverted this pattern. Deloitte's 2025 survey of 23,000 respondents across 44 countries finds that 57% of Generation Z employees (born 1995–2010) use generative AI in their daily work, and 70% are actively investing time to develop AI-related skills. A study by International Workplace Group (2025) reports that 59% of Gen Z workers are coaching older colleagues on AI use—a phenomenon sometimes called "reverse mentoring." McKinsey's Superagency research (2025) reveals a striking perception gap: employees using AI for more than 30% of their daily tasks outnumber what C-suite leaders estimate by a factor of 3.25 (13% vs. 4%). In short, **managers often do not know how heavily their subordinates rely on AI**.

This generational inversion in technological competence has theoretical implications. Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), articulated by Pfeffer and Salancik (1978), holds that power accrues to those who control resources others need but cannot easily obtain. Tripathi (2021) extended this logic inward: employees, too, can be "hosts of tacit resources"—holders of firm-specific knowledge that supervisors depend on but do not themselves possess. When that knowledge concerns AI, and when younger employees hold more of it than their managers do, the traditional resource asymmetry between supervisor and subordinate shifts.

AI literacy is precisely such a resource. This study adopts the three-dimensional framework proposed by Zhong, Liu, and Yang (2024): *AI knowledge* (understanding of AI concepts and technologies), *AI affectivity* (emotional attitudes and motivation toward AI), and *AI thinking* (higher-order cognitive skills for integrating AI into problem-solving). When Generation Z employees outpace their supervisors on these dimensions, they acquire an informal resource advantage—one that, in principle, should enable upward influence.

But does it? And under what conditions?

This is the puzzle the present study addresses. Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997) suggests that objective competence does not translate directly into action; a psychological intermediary—self-efficacy—must intervene. Employees need not only to *possess* AI literacy but to *recognize* that they hold an advantage relative to their supervisors. This subjective awareness—what I term *perceived resource advantage*—is what drives behavior. Leadership Construction Theory (DeRue & Ashford, 2010) further reminds us that influence is relational: an employee's "claiming" requires a supervisor's "granting." If supervisors are open to input from below, resource advantages are more likely to convert into actual influence; if supervisors are closed, even highly capable employees may remain silent.

The Chinese organizational context adds a distinctive theoretical tension. China is characterized by high power distance (Hofstede, 2001): deference to hierarchy is normative, and upward influence is, in a sense, counter-cultural. Yet China's aggressive push for digital transformation—symbolized by the national "AI+" strategy—is colliding with these traditional norms. When AI literacy becomes a strategic resource that organizations urgently need, will cultural constraints yield to technological empowerment? This tension makes China a compelling site for studying AI-driven workplace power dynamics.

1.2 Research Objectives

The central question of this study is: **How does AI literacy enable Generation Z employees to influence their supervisors?**

Four objectives flow from this question:

**First**, to identify mechanisms. How does AI literacy translate into upward influence behavior? How do employees come to perceive their resource advantage? How does that perception motivate action? What forms does influence take—idea generation, idea promotion, idea implementation?

**Second**, to understand boundary conditions. How does supervisor openness moderate the relationship between perceived resource advantage and upward influence? What makes some supervisors more receptive to AI-related input from below? How do employees gauge whether to speak up or stay silent?

**Third**, to advance theory. The study shifts Resource Dependence Theory's unit of analysis from inter-organizational relations to the supervisor-subordinate dyad, tests its explanatory power for a novel resource type (AI literacy), and places it in dialogue with Social Cognitive Theory and Leadership Construction Theory.

**Fourth**, to distill practical insights. The study aims to offer evidence-based guidance on how organizations can unlock the AI-enabled potential of young employees and foster bidirectional intergenerational knowledge flows.

1.3 Research Significance

1.3.1 Theoretical Significance

This study makes three contributions to the organizational behavior literature.

**First, it extends Resource Dependence Theory to the employee-supervisor level.** RDT has traditionally been applied to inter-organizational relations (supplier-firm, firm-government). Tripathi (2021) demonstrated its applicability within organizations, but empirical studies identifying *which specific resources* create employee-to-supervisor dependency remain rare. By focusing on AI literacy, this study tests how a contemporary, strategically important resource reshapes workplace power dynamics—offering the theory a new, operationalizable proving ground.

**Second, it shifts AI literacy research toward a behavioral lens.** The AI literacy literature has concentrated on conceptualization and measurement, primarily in educational settings (Ng et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2024). Far less attention has been paid to workplace behavioral consequences—especially interpersonal influence. This study addresses that gap, examining how individual AI competence translates into organizational influence.

**Third, it identifies AI literacy as a new antecedent of upward influence.** Existing research on upward influence highlights political skill and leader-member exchange quality as key predictors. In a context of technology-driven generational dynamics, AI literacy as a source of expert power has yet to be systematically examined. This study bridges digital transformation and workplace power research.

1.3.2 Practical Significance

The findings will offer guidance for organizations navigating digital transformation.

For HR managers, understanding how AI literacy converts into organizational influence can inform talent development strategies: How should young employees' AI capabilities be cultivated and incentivized? How can their technical resources be integrated into organizational decision-making?

For supervisors themselves, the study will illuminate the critical role that *openness* plays in surfacing subordinates' potential—prompting reflection on how receptive they are to input from below and to new technologies.

In the Chinese context, organizations face the dual pressures of rapid technological change and traditional hierarchical culture. This study offers a framework for understanding that tension, helping managers create conditions for young employees' AI advantages to be realized while respecting cultural norms.

CHAPTER II LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Resource Dependence Theory and Upward Influence

2.1.1 Theoretical Foundations of Resource Dependence Theory

Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), originally developed by Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) in their seminal work “The External Control of Organizations,” provides a powerful framework for understanding power dynamics in organizational contexts. At its core, RDT posits that power is fundamentally about the control of resources that others need but cannot easily obtain elsewhere. As Pfeffer and Salancik articulated, when Actor A possesses resources that Actor B needs but lacks, B becomes dependent on A, and A acquires a power base for influencing B.

The theory identifies several key factors that determine the extent of resource-based power: (1) the importance of the resource to the dependent party, (2) the scarcity of the resource, (3) the concentration of resource control, and (4) the availability of alternative sources. When a resource is both important and scarce, and when alternatives are limited, the party controlling that resource gains significant influence over those who depend on it.

2.1.2 Extending RDT to Employee-Supervisor Relationships

While RDT was initially developed to explain inter-organizational relationships, recent scholarship has extended its application to within-organization dynamics. Tripathi (2021), in a groundbreaking theoretical paper published in Frontiers in Psychology, argued that the same principles of resource dependence can explain the power dynamics between employees and their supervisors. Tripathi introduced the concept of employees as “hosts of tacit resources”—individuals who possess unique, firm-specific human capital that managers need but cannot easily replicate.

According to Tripathi’s framework, when employees hold valuable and scarce resources, they can engage in “claiming” behaviors—actively asserting their competence and seeking recognition from supervisors. This aligns with the Leadership Construction Theory proposed by DeRue and Ashford (2010), which suggests that leadership is not solely a top-down phenomenon but is co-constructed through the interaction between “claiming” (asserting leadership identity) and “granting” (receiving recognition from others).

2.1.3 Tripathi’s Framework: Employees as Resource Holders

Tripathi’s (2021) theoretical framework, published in Frontiers in Psychology, provides the most direct application of Resource Dependence Theory to the employee-supervisor relationship, and serves as the primary theoretical foundation for this study. The framework introduces several key concepts that are central to understanding how AI literacy enables upward influence.

First, Tripathi conceptualizes employees as “hosts of tacit resources”—individuals who possess unique, firm-specific human capital that is valuable to managers but difficult to replicate or transfer. Unlike generic skills that can be easily hired from the external labor market, firm-specific human capital is developed through experience within a particular organizational context and becomes increasingly valuable over time. In the context of AI, this tacit knowledge includes not only technical AI skills but also understanding of how to apply AI tools to specific organizational problems and workflows.

Second, the framework distinguishes between two types of dependency relationships: power imbalance and embedded (or joint) dependence. Power imbalance occurs when one party is significantly more dependent on the other, creating an asymmetric relationship. Embedded dependence, in contrast, involves mutual reliance where both parties need each other. The AI literacy context often creates power imbalance in favor of younger employees who possess scarce technological competencies that their supervisors lack.

Third, Tripathi emphasizes that the conversion of resources into influence depends on several boundary conditions, including organizational structure (mechanistic vs. organic) and team composition (expert vs. homogeneous). This insight informs the inclusion of supervisor openness as a moderating variable in this study—the extent to which supervisors are receptive to employee input represents a critical contextual factor that shapes whether resource advantages translate into actual influence.

Finally, the framework connects to Leadership Construction Theory (DeRue & Ashford, 2010) by highlighting the interactive nature of influence. Employees must engage in “claiming” behaviors—actively asserting their competence and seeking opportunities to contribute—while supervisors must engage in “granting” behaviors—acknowledging employee expertise and providing opportunities for input. This dual process suggests that AI literacy alone is insufficient; employees must also perceive their advantage and have supervisors who are open to their contributions.

2.2 AI Literacy: Conceptualization and Frameworks

2.2.1 Defining AI Literacy

AI literacy has emerged as a critical concept in both educational and organizational research. Unlike general digital literacy, which encompasses broad competencies related to information technology, AI literacy specifically addresses the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and ethical awareness needed to effectively interact with AI systems (Long & Magerko, 2020).

Several frameworks have been proposed to conceptualize AI literacy. Ng et al. (2023) developed the ABCE model, which includes four dimensions: Affective (attitudes toward AI), Behavioral (ability to use AI tools), Cognitive (understanding of AI concepts), and Ethical (awareness of AI-related ethical issues). This framework was validated with Hong Kong secondary students and has been applied in various educational contexts.

2.2.2 Zhong’s Three-Dimensional Framework

Particularly relevant to the Chinese context is the three-dimensional framework proposed by Zhong et al. (2024) in their article “What is AI Literacy: Essence, Composition, and Evaluation System” published in the Journal of East China Normal University. Zhong’s framework conceptualizes AI literacy as comprising three interrelated dimensions:

(1) AI Knowledge (AI知识): This dimension encompasses declarative and procedural knowledge about AI, including understanding of AI concepts, technologies, applications, and limitations. It represents the cognitive foundation of AI literacy.

(2) AI Affectivity (AI情感): This dimension captures emotional and attitudinal responses to AI, including interest, confidence, and value perceptions. Affective engagement with AI influences motivation to learn and use AI tools.

(3) AI Thinking (AI思维): This dimension reflects higher-order cognitive skills related to AI, including computational thinking, engineering design thinking, and critical evaluation of AI systems. It represents the ability to think with and about AI.

Zhong’s framework is grounded in Piaget’s genetic epistemology and Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, providing a theoretically robust foundation. The framework emphasizes the dynamic transformation among the three dimensions, suggesting that AI literacy develops through the interplay of knowing, feeling, and thinking about AI.

Although developed within educational research, Zhong's framework captures AI literacy as an internalized cognitive and affective capacity—the foundation upon which workplace behaviors are built. The three dimensions describe how individuals know, feel, and think about AI, capacities that are not context-bound but rather form the basis for context-specific applications.

2.2.3 AI Literacy in Organizational Contexts

While most research on AI literacy has focused on educational settings, Cetindamar et al. (2022) made an important contribution by explicating AI literacy in the context of digital workplaces. Their study, published in IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, identified key competencies that employees need to effectively use AI tools in professional settings. Wang et al. (2022) further developed and validated an AI literacy scale specifically designed for general users, demonstrating good reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.906) in Chinese samples.

Table 2.1 Comparison of AI Literacy Frameworks

|

| Framework | Dimensions | Context | Key Features |
| Ng et al. (2023) ABCE Model | Affective, Behavioral, Cognitive, Ethical | Education (Hong Kong) | 32 items, validated with secondary students |
| Zhong et al. (2024) Three-Dimensional | AI Knowledge, AI Affectivity, AI Thinking | Education (China) | 48 items, grounded in Piaget and Bloom |
| Wang et al. (2022) | Cognitive, Use, Evaluation, Ethics | General users (China) | 12 items, α = 0.906 |
| Cetindamar et al. (2022) | Multiple competencies | Workplace | Exploratory, qualitative approach |

2.3 Upward Influence Behavior in Organizations

2.3.1 Conceptualizing Upward Influence

Upward influence refers to employees’ attempts to affect the attitudes, perceptions, or behaviors of their supervisors or other organizational members who hold higher positions (Kipnis et al., 1980). Unlike downward influence, which flows from managers to subordinates and is often supported by formal authority, upward influence requires employees to rely on alternative power bases such as expertise, information control, or personal relationships.

The study of upward influence has a rich tradition in organizational behavior research. Kipnis, Schmidt, and Wilkinson (1980) developed the foundational taxonomy of influence tactics, identifying strategies such as rational persuasion, ingratiation, coalition building, and pressure. Subsequent research has refined this taxonomy and examined the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of upward influence across different contexts.

It is worth distinguishing upward influence behavior from reverse mentoring—a related but distinct phenomenon. Reverse mentoring typically refers to formalized organizational arrangements in which junior employees are paired with senior colleagues to share specialized expertise (Murphy, 2012). The key distinction lies in origin: reverse mentoring is **institutionally mandated**, whereas upward influence behavior is **self-initiated**.

This study focuses on the latter, as it better aligns with the workplace characteristics of Generation Z. As noted in Section 2.4.1, Gen Z employees value authenticity and autonomy, and are willing to challenge established norms (Schroth, 2019). They are driven by a desire to have their ideas heard and implemented, rather than simply participating in assigned programs. Upward influence behavior, as a proactive and employee-driven activity, captures this spontaneous agency and the desire to make a direct impact on the organization.

2.3.2 Dimensions of Upward Influence Behavior

Building on Scott and Bruce’s (1994) conceptualization of innovation behavior, upward influence can be understood as encompassing multiple stages or dimensions:

(1) Idea Generation: The initial stage involves identifying opportunities for improvement or innovation and developing ideas that could benefit the organization. In the context of AI literacy, this might involve recognizing how AI tools could enhance work processes.

(2) Idea Promotion: Once ideas are generated, employees must advocate for them to gain support from supervisors and other stakeholders. This requires communication skills, political awareness, and the ability to frame ideas in ways that resonate with organizational priorities.

(3) Idea Implementation: The final stage involves translating approved ideas into action. This may require coordinating with others, overcoming resistance, and demonstrating the value of the proposed changes.

Table 2.2 Dimensions of Upward Influence Behavior

| Dimension | Definition | AI Literacy Application |
| Idea Generation | Identifying opportunities and developing solutions | Recognizing how AI can improve work processes |
| Idea Promotion | Advocating for ideas to gain support | Communicating AI benefits to supervisors |
| Idea Implementation | Translating ideas into action | Leading AI adoption initiatives |

2.3.3 Antecedents of Upward Influence

Research has identified various factors that enable or constrain upward influence behavior. At the individual level, factors such as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997), political skill, and expertise have been shown to predict influence attempts. At the relational level, the quality of leader-member exchange (LMX) and trust between employees and supervisors affect the likelihood and success of upward influence.

Particularly relevant to this study is the role of expertise as a power base for upward influence. When employees possess specialized knowledge or skills that supervisors lack, they gain “expert power” that can be leveraged to influence organizational decisions (French & Raven, 1959). AI literacy, as a form of technological expertise that is often more developed among younger employees, represents a contemporary manifestation of this dynamic.

2.4 Generation Z in the Workplace

2.4.1 Characteristics of Generation Z

Generation Z, typically defined as individuals born between 1995 and 2010, represents the newest cohort entering the workforce. As true “digital natives,” Gen Z employees have grown up with smartphones, social media, and ubiquitous internet connectivity. This has shaped their cognitive styles, communication preferences, and expectations for work (Seemiller & Grace, 2016).

Research on Gen Z in the workplace has identified several distinctive characteristics. Gen Z employees tend to be technologically fluent, comfortable with multitasking, and expect to use digital tools in their work. They value authenticity, diversity, and meaningful work, and may be more willing than previous generations to challenge organizational norms that they perceive as outdated or inefficient (Schroth, 2019).

Furthermore, Schroth (2019) highlights a fundamental shift in the psychological contract for Generation Z. Unlike previous generations who might view respect as deference to hierarchy, Gen Z employees equate respect with **being heard**. They possess a strong "do-it-yourself" mindset and a desire for autonomy, often preferring to drive solutions themselves rather than waiting for top-down directives. Consequently, when they perceive organizational inefficiencies, their instinct is not to withdraw but to actively seek influence, expecting their unique perspectives—including their digital expertise—to be validated by their supervisors.

2.4.2 Generational Dynamics and Power

The entry of Generation Z into the workforce has created interesting dynamics around knowledge and power. In traditional organizations, knowledge and expertise typically accumulated with tenure, reinforcing the authority of senior employees. However, the rapid pace of technological change has disrupted this pattern. In the domain of AI and digital technologies, younger employees often possess superior skills, creating what some scholars have termed a “reverse knowledge gap.”

This dynamic has implications for power relationships in organizations. According to Resource Dependence Theory, when younger employees control resources (i.e., AI competencies) that are valuable to supervisors and the organization, they acquire influence that would not traditionally be available to new or junior employees. This represents a potential shift in organizational power dynamics that merits empirical investigation.

2.4.3 The Chinese Organizational Context

The Chinese organizational context presents unique characteristics that make this research particularly relevant and theoretically interesting. China is characterized by high power distance (Hofstede, 2001), meaning that hierarchical relationships and deference to authority are culturally emphasized. In traditional Chinese organizations, subordinates are expected to show respect for their superiors and may be hesitant to challenge or openly influence those in positions of authority.

Empirical studies confirm this pattern: high power distance has been shown to suppress employee voice behavior in Chinese organizations (Chen et al., 2013), as subordinates weigh the relational costs of speaking up. Yet the picture is not purely one of constraint. Liang et al. (2019) found that supervisor-subordinate guanxi operates as a double-edged sword—close relationships provide psychological safety that encourages voice, but simultaneously raise concerns about "face" (mianzi), as employees worry that suggestions may be perceived as implicit criticism of their supervisor's competence.

However, several contemporary forces are creating tensions with these traditional norms. First, China’s rapid digital transformation, accelerated by the national “AI+” strategy, has created urgent demand for AI competencies that younger employees are more likely to possess. Second, the large cohort of Generation Z entering the workforce brings different expectations about workplace dynamics, including greater comfort with challenging established practices. Third, multinational companies and technology firms in China often adopt flatter organizational structures that may encourage more open communication across hierarchical levels.

These tensions create a particularly interesting context for studying AI-enabled upward influence. On one hand, cultural norms may suppress influence attempts even when employees possess valuable resources. On the other hand, the strategic importance of AI competencies may override traditional hierarchical constraints, creating new pathways for young employees to gain voice and influence. The moderating role of supervisor openness becomes especially critical in this context, as it represents a potential bridge between traditional hierarchical expectations and emerging technology-driven influence patterns.

2.5 Research Gaps and Theoretical Framework

2.5.1 Identified Research Gaps

Despite growing interest in AI literacy and generational dynamics in the workplace, several important research gaps remain:

First, while AI literacy has been extensively studied in educational contexts, its implications for organizational behavior—particularly power and influence dynamics—remain underexplored. How AI literacy translates into workplace influence represents an important question for both theory and practice.

Second, although Resource Dependence Theory provides a compelling framework for understanding power dynamics, few studies have specifically examined AI literacy as a resource that enables upward influence. The mechanisms by which AI competencies are converted into organizational influence warrant investigation.

Third, the role of contextual factors, particularly supervisor attitudes toward employee input and new technologies, in shaping the AI literacy-influence relationship has received limited attention. Understanding these boundary conditions is crucial for developing a nuanced theory of AI-enabled upward influence.

2.5.2 Theoretical Framework and Research Propositions

Based on the literature review, this study proposes a theoretical framework linking AI literacy to upward influence behavior through the mediating mechanism of perceived resource advantage, with supervisor openness as a moderating factor.

$$Insert Figure 2.1 Research Framework Here$$

The framework is grounded in Resource Dependence Theory and proposes the following relationships:

Proposition 1 (P1): AI literacy positively relates to employees’ perceived resource advantage.

When employees possess high levels of AI literacy—including AI knowledge, AI affectivity, and AI thinking—they are more likely to perceive themselves as holding a resource advantage relative to their supervisors. This perception is particularly strong when employees recognize that their AI competencies exceed those of their managers and are valued by the organization.

Proposition 2 (P2): Perceived resource advantage enables employees to engage in upward influence behavior.

Building on Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997), the perception of holding valuable resources should increase employees’ self-efficacy and motivation to attempt upward influence. When employees believe they possess something that supervisors need, they are more likely to engage in idea generation, promotion, and implementation behaviors.

Proposition 3 (P3): Perceived resource advantage mediates the relationship between AI literacy and upward influence behavior.

The effect of AI literacy on upward influence is not direct but operates through the psychological mechanism of perceived resource advantage. Objective AI competencies must be subjectively recognized as conferring an advantage before they translate into influence behavior.

Proposition 4 (P4): Supervisor openness moderates the relationship between perceived resource advantage and upward influence behavior.

Drawing on Leadership Construction Theory (DeRue & Ashford, 2010), the success of upward influence depends not only on the employee’s claiming behavior but also on the supervisor’s granting behavior. In the Chinese high power distance context, supervisor openness—defined as the extent to which supervisors are receptive to employee input and new ideas (Detert & Burris, 2007)—should significantly moderate whether perceived resource advantage translates into actual influence attempts and success.

2.5.3 Summary of Research Propositions

Based on the theoretical framework developed above, this study proposes the following research propositions to guide the qualitative inquiry:

Proposition 1 (P1): AI Literacy → Perceived Resource Advantage

Generation Z employees with higher levels of AI literacy (encompassing AI knowledge, AI affectivity, and AI thinking) are more likely to perceive themselves as holding a resource advantage relative to their supervisors. This proposition is grounded in Resource Dependence Theory’s assertion that controlling scarce, valuable resources creates a power base.

Proposition 2 (P2): Perceived Resource Advantage → Upward Influence Behavior

Employees who perceive that they possess AI-related resources that their supervisors need but lack are more likely to engage in upward influence behavior, including generating new ideas, promoting ideas to leadership, and implementing changes. This proposition draws on Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1997), which suggests that self-efficacy beliefs—in this case, confidence derived from perceived resource advantage—drive behavioral action.

Proposition 3 (P3): Mediation Effect

The relationship between AI literacy and upward influence behavior is mediated by perceived resource advantage. That is, objective AI competencies must first be subjectively recognized as conferring an advantage before they motivate influence attempts. This proposition reflects the psychological mechanism through which external resources are translated into behavioral outcomes.

Proposition 4 (P4): Moderation Effect of Supervisor Openness

The relationship between perceived resource advantage and upward influence behavior is moderated by supervisor openness. When supervisors are receptive to input from subordinates and open to new technologies, employees with perceived resource advantages are more likely to engage in upward influence. Conversely, when supervisors are closed to input, even employees with significant resource advantages may refrain from influence attempts. This proposition acknowledges the relational nature of influence and the importance of contextual factors, particularly in high power distance cultures like China.

CHAPTER III RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

3.1 Research Design and Justification

This study adopts a qualitative research approach, specifically utilizing semi-structured in-depth interviews, to explore how AI literacy influences upward influence behavior among Generation Z employees. The choice of qualitative methodology over quantitative approaches is justified by several methodological and practical considerations.

Exploratory Nature of the Research Question

The phenomenon under investigation—how AI literacy translates into organizational influence through perceived resource advantage—is relatively novel and has not been extensively studied empirically. While Resource Dependence Theory provides a general framework for understanding power dynamics, its specific application to AI literacy and generational dynamics in the workplace represents new theoretical territory. Qualitative methods are well-suited for such exploratory research, allowing for the discovery of unexpected themes and the development of grounded theoretical insights (Creswell & Poth, 2018).

Need for Process Understanding

This study seeks to understand not merely whether AI literacy relates to upward influence, but how this relationship operates—the mechanisms, processes, and contextual factors involved. Quantitative methods, while valuable for testing causal relationships, may not adequately capture the richness of employees’ experiences, perceptions, and interpretations. In-depth interviews allow participants to describe their experiences in their own words, revealing nuances that predetermined survey items might miss.

Alignment with Institutional Emphasis

This research approach aligns with the emphasis on field research and social investigation in undergraduate education at this institution. Conducting qualitative interviews provides valuable opportunities for direct engagement with research participants and the development of practical research skills.

Methodological Precedent

Qualitative methods have been successfully employed in prior research on related topics, including studies of generational dynamics in the workplace (Watkins & Omilion-Hodges, 2025), upward influence processes (Kamaşak et al., 2017), and AI adoption in organizations (Cassell & Symon, 2004). These precedents support the appropriateness of qualitative inquiry for the current research questions.

3.2 Sample and Sampling Strategy

3.2.1 Target Population

The target population for this study consists of Generation Z knowledge workers in China who use AI tools in their daily work. Knowledge workers are defined as employees whose primary contribution involves the creation, distribution, or application of knowledge, as opposed to manual or routine clerical work.

3.2.2 Sampling Criteria

Participants will be selected based on the following criteria:

Table 3.1 Participant Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Requirement | Rationale |
| Age/Generation | Born 1995-2010 (Generation Z) | Focus on digital natives |
| Employment | At least 6 months full-time work experience | Ensure sufficient workplace exposure |
| AI Usage | Regular use of AI tools at work | Ensure relevance to research topic |
| Job Type | Knowledge work (non-manual) | Focus on contexts where AI literacy is relevant |

3.2.3 Sample Size and Saturation

Following the principle of theoretical saturation in qualitative research (Guest et al., 2020), this study targets a sample size of 15-20 participants. Research indicates that for relatively homogeneous samples, thematic saturation is typically achieved within 12-20 interviews, with 80% or more of themes emerging within the first 6-12 interviews (Guest et al., 2020; Malterud et al., 2016; Hennink & Kaiser, 2021).

The sample size will be confirmed through ongoing assessment of saturation during data collection. If new themes continue to emerge after 15 interviews, additional participants will be recruited until saturation is achieved.

3.2.4 Sampling Strategy

This study employs purposive sampling combined with snowball sampling. Initial participants will be identified through the researcher’s professional and academic networks, targeting individuals who meet the selection criteria. Subsequently, participants will be asked to recommend other potential participants who might be interested in the study (snowball sampling).

To enhance sample diversity, the researcher will seek participants from different industries, company sizes, and functional areas. This variation will enable exploration of how contextual factors shape the AI literacy-upward influence relationship.

3.3 Data Collection

3.3.1 Interview Method

Data will be collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews. This method allows for systematic coverage of key topics while providing flexibility to explore unexpected themes and follow participants’ narratives (Kvale & Brinkmann, 2009).

Each interview is expected to last 45-60 minutes and will be conducted either in person or via video call, depending on participant preference and logistical considerations. Interviews will be audio-recorded with participant consent and subsequently transcribed verbatim for analysis.

3.3.2 Interview Procedure

The interview procedure will follow these steps:

(1) Pre-interview: Send informed consent form and brief overview of topics to participants.

(2) Opening (5 minutes): Establish rapport, explain study purpose, confirm consent, address questions.

(3) Main interview (40-50 minutes): Work through interview guide, probing for depth and examples.

(4) Closing (5 minutes): Summarize key points, invite additional comments, explain next steps.

(5) Post-interview: Record researcher reflections and observations in field notes.

3.4 Interview Guide

The interview guide is structured around the key constructs in the research framework, moving from general to specific topics.

Table 3.2 Interview Guide Structure

| Topic Area | Sample Questions | Construct |
| Background | “Please describe your current role and how you use AI tools in your work.” | Context |
| AI Literacy | “How did you learn to use AI tools? How would you compare your AI skills to your colleagues and supervisor?” | AI Literacy |
| Perceived Advantage | “Do you feel you have any advantages over your supervisor when it comes to AI? Can you give examples?” | Perceived Resource Advantage |
| Upward Influence | “Have you ever used your AI knowledge to influence your supervisor’s decisions or the way work is done? What happened?” | Upward Influence Behavior |
| Supervisor Response | “How does your supervisor typically respond when you make AI-related suggestions? What factors affect their openness?” | Supervisor Openness |
| Contextual Factors | “What aspects of your organization’s culture help or hinder you in making suggestions to leadership?” | Boundary Conditions |

3.5 Data Analysis

3.5.1 Analytical Approach

Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, following the six-phase approach outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006) and further developed by Naeem et al. (2023):

Phase 1: Familiarization with Data

Read and re-read all interview transcripts

Note initial ideas and observations

Become immersed in the data

Phase 2: Generating Initial Codes

Systematically code interesting features across the entire dataset

Collate data relevant to each code

Use both inductive (data-driven) and deductive (theory-driven) coding

Phase 3: Searching for Themes

Collate codes into potential themes

Gather all data relevant to each potential theme

Create initial thematic maps

Phase 4: Reviewing Themes

Check if themes work in relation to coded extracts and entire dataset

Generate a thematic map of the analysis

Refine themes as needed

Phase 5: Defining and Naming Themes

Refine the specifics of each theme

Generate clear definitions and names for each theme

Identify the “story” each theme tells

Phase 6: Producing the Report

Select vivid, compelling extract examples

Relate analysis back to research questions and literature

Produce a scholarly report of the analysis

3.5.2 Coding Strategy

The coding process will combine deductive and inductive approaches. Deductive codes will be derived from the theoretical framework, including categories for AI literacy dimensions, perceived resource advantage, upward influence behaviors, and supervisor openness. Inductive codes will emerge from the data to capture unexpected themes and nuances.

A codebook will be developed and refined throughout the analysis process to ensure consistency and transparency (Roberts et al., 2019).

3.6 Quality Assurance
