## 问题动机

**来源**: 与导师讨论 (2024-12-13)

**背景**: 
导师提出假设："领导的学历和经历越好，就越容易被有AI素养的年轻人影响到。"这引发了我们对Supervisor Openness这个调节变量的思考——在我们的模型中，Supervisor Openness是P4的核心调节变量，但我们还没有深入探讨**什么因素决定了上级的开放性**。

**期望**: 
找到文献支持（或反驳）导师的假设，并为论文2.5.2节（Supervisor Openness部分）补充更多理论依据。如果有重要发现，可能需要调整访谈提纲，加入探索上级特征的问题。

## Context
I am conducting a qualitative study on how AI literacy enables Generation Z employees to engage in upward influence behavior in Chinese organizations. 

My theoretical framework is based on Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978; Tripathi, 2021), examining how AI literacy creates a resource-based power that enables employees to influence their supervisors.

Key constructs in my study:
- AI Literacy: AI knowledge, AI affectivity, AI thinking (Zhong et al., 2024)
- Perceived Resource Advantage: Employees' subjective perception of holding AI-related resources their supervisors need but lack
- Upward Influence Behavior: Idea generation, promotion, and implementation
- **Supervisor Openness**: The extent to which supervisors are receptive to subordinate input (MODERATOR in my model)

Currently, I have completed the literature review and methodology chapters, and I am preparing for qualitative interviews.

## Why I'm Asking
In my theoretical model, I propose that Supervisor Openness moderates the relationship between perceived resource advantage and upward influence behavior (P4). However, my supervisor raised an interesting hypothesis: "Supervisors with higher education and more technology experience are more likely to be receptive to AI-related suggestions from younger employees."

I need to examine what the literature says about the **antecedents of supervisor openness**. Specifically:
1. Does educational background predict openness?
2. Does prior technology experience predict openness?
3. Does learning goal orientation (growth mindset) predict openness?

I want to know if this is an established finding or if it's a gap I should explore in my interviews.

## My Question
What factors have been empirically identified as antecedents of supervisor openness to subordinate input (employee voice, creative ideas, upward influence attempts)? 

Specifically, I'm looking for studies that examine whether supervisors' educational background, prior technology/digital experience, or learning goal orientation predict their receptiveness to ideas from lower-status or younger employees.

I'm also open to discovering dimensions I'm not aware of. If there are other antecedents (e.g., humble leadership, psychological safety, status threat) that the literature discusses, please include them.

## Output Requirements
Please act as an experienced organizational behavior researcher with expertise in leadership and employee voice literature. Provide specific details from relevant studies, including:

1. **Research methodology**: Was it quantitative (survey, experiment) or qualitative? Sample size? Country/industry context?
2. **Variable measurement**: How was "openness" or "receptivity" operationalized? What scales were used? How many items?
3. **Specific findings**: What were the effect sizes (β, r)? What were the confidence intervals? In qualitative studies, what were the key quotes or themes?
4. **Argumentation logic**: How did the authors explain WHY this antecedent affects openness? What theoretical mechanisms were proposed?
5. **Boundary conditions**: Under what conditions did the effect hold or not hold? What moderators were identified?
6. **Limitations**: What did the authors acknowledge as limitations?

Do NOT just provide conclusions like "Learning orientation is positively related to openness." I need the granular details of the studies—sample characteristics, measurement details, and effect sizes—so I can evaluate whether these findings are applicable to my Chinese organizational context.

### 原始问题 Q1-v1

> In organizational behavior research, what factors have been identified as antecedents of supervisor openness to subordinate input (e.g., employee voice, upward influence)? Specifically, are there studies examining whether supervisors' educational background, prior technology experience, or learning orientation predict their receptiveness to ideas from younger or lower-status employees?

### 回答摘要（结论性，缺乏颗粒度）

Consensus给出了以下结论：
- 领导行为与沟通风格影响开放性 (Mayfield et al., 2023; Detert & Burris, 2007)
- 心理安全与地位感知 (Janssen & Gao, 2015)
- 低地位上级更易排斥新想法 (Venkataramani et al., 2023)
- 教育背景和技术经验**缺乏直接实证检验**

### 问题分析

❌ 回答只给结论，没有说明：
- 具体用了什么样本？
- Detert & Burris (2007) 是如何测量openness的？
- 效应量是多少？
- 在什么条件下成立？

**结论**: 需要用优化版问题(v2)重新提问

## Context
[同上]

## Why I'm Asking
In my literature review, I've referenced Detert & Burris (2007) "Leadership Behavior and Employee Voice: Is the Door Really Open?" as a key source for supervisor openness. However, I've only cited the general finding. I need to understand this paper in more depth to properly use it in my theoretical framework.

## My Question
Please provide a detailed analysis of Detert & Burris (2007) paper on leadership behavior and employee voice:

1. What was their research design and sample?
2. How did they conceptualize and measure "managerial openness"?
3. What specific leadership behaviors did they find predicted voice?
4. What were the effect sizes for key relationships?
5. How did they theorize WHY openness matters for voice?
6. What boundary conditions or moderators did they identify?
7. What are the limitations they acknowledged?

This will help me properly understand and cite this foundational paper in my literature review.

## Output Requirements
Please provide detailed information including exact measurement items if available, sample description, statistical results (β, R², etc.), and the authors' theoretical reasoning. I need specifics, not just "openness was positively related to voice."

## Context
[同上]

## Why I'm Asking
My study is about younger employees (Gen Z) with AI skills influencing older supervisors. This is conceptually similar to "reverse mentoring" where knowledge flows from junior to senior. I want to understand what makes senior employees (in my case, supervisors) successfully learn from juniors.

## My Question
In empirical studies of reverse mentoring, what characteristics of senior employees (mentees) predicted their successful learning from younger mentors?

I'm specifically interested in:
1. Studies conducted in technology/AI/digital skills domains
2. The role of learning orientation or growth mindset of the mentee
3. How "successful learning" was operationalized and measured
4. Whether ego threat or status concerns moderated the effect

## Output Requirements
Please provide study-level details:
- Sample: Who were the participants? What industry/country?
- Method: Survey? Interview? Experiment?
- Measurement: How was "successful learning" measured?
- Findings: Specific coefficients, effect sizes, or key qualitative themes
- Mechanisms: Why do certain characteristics predict success?

I need these details to evaluate whether findings from reverse mentoring literature are applicable to my study of AI-enabled upward influence.

## 研究需求说明

### 为什么这些问题很重要？

1. **回应导师反馈**：导师提出假设"领导学历/经历更好 → 更容易被AI素养年轻人影响"，我们需要找到文献支持或反驳这个观点

2. **保持论文聚焦**：我们**不**讨论"代际冲突是否存在"这个宏大问题，而是聚焦于**Supervisor Openness**这个具体调节变量的形成机制

3. **可能的论文补充位置**：
   - 如果找到支持文献 → 在2.5.2（Supervisor Openness部分）补充
   - 在访谈提纲中加入相关探索性问题
   - 在讨论章节（Chapter V）中讨论

### 关键词提示

- Supervisor openness / managerial openness
- Leader learning orientation / growth mindset
- Reverse mentoring / intergenerational learning
- Status threat / ego threat
- Humble leadership
