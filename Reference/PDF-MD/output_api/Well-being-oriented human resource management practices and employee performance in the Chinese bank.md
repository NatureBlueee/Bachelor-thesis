Drawing upon positive psychology and a social relational perspective, this article examines the relationship between well-being-oriented human resource management (HRM) practices and employee performance. Our multilevel model examines relationships among collectively experienced well-being-oriented HRM practices, social climate (characterized by trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language that exist among individuals within the organization), employee resilience, and employee (in-role) performance. Based on the two-wave data obtained from 561 employees and their managers within 62 bank branches in 16 Chinese banks, our multilevel analyses provide support for our four hypotheses. First, we found a positive relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate. Second, social climate mediated the relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience. Third, we found a positive relationship between resilience and employee performance. Finally, employee resilience mediated the relationship between social climate and employee performance. This study is one of the first to unpack the social mechanisms through which well-being-oriented HRM practices increase development of resilience and subsequent employee performance at the workplace, namely through influencing group feelings of social climate.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

Despite the continued interest in human resource management (HRM) research and its impact on individual and ultimately organizational performance (Boxall, Ang, & Bartram, 2011; Guest & Conway, 2011; Kehoe & Wright, 2013), there still remain large gaps in our understanding of the mediating mechanisms through which HRM leads to sustainable and increased performance (Jiang, Takeuchi, & Lepak, 2013). HRM systems are designed to enhance employee skills, commitment, and ultimately performance (Boxall & Macky, 2007; Datta, Guthrie, & Wright, 2005; Guest & Conway, 2011; Paauewe, Wright, & Guest, 2013). Our article builds on a recent call by Jiang et al. (2013) to further examine the mediating mechanisms across multiple levels of analysis to extend the academic and practitioner understanding of the process through which HRM may impact

performance. It also responds to Guest's (2017) call for a new theoretical approach to enhancing employee well-being through HRM. Guest (2017) conceptualizes well-being-oriented HRM practices as designed to promote investment in employees (e.g., training, development, and learning), provision of engaging work (e.g., jobs with appropriate workload, role clarity and employee control, and information sharing), a positive social and physical environment (e.g., employment security and teams), employee voice (e.g., extensive two-way communication between management and employees), and organizational support (e.g., participative and supportive management).

Guest (2017, p. 22) argues the "search for a link between HRM and performance has been pursued at the expense of concern for employee well-being" and "what is therefore needed is a different approach to HRM that is more likely to enhance employee well-being but which may also offer an alternative route to high performance."

This is an important argument given contemporary workplace challenges such as increased job stress associated with the lack of employment security and work intensification, and the growing interest in sustainable and ethical HRM practices (Voegtlin & Greenwood, 2016). There has also been growing interest among HR practitioners in positive psychology. Positive psychology emphasizes employee well-being, happiness, and constructive cognitions such as resilience as a route toward enhanced employee performance (Seligman, 2002; Youssef & Luthans, 2005). We examine resilience as a key psychological capacity for enhancing employee well-being and performance (Luthans, Avey, Avolio, & Peterson, 2010). Despite this growing interest, the academic and practitioner understanding of the process through which HRM practices effect the well-being and performance of employees is underdeveloped, as Guest (2017) argued. Moreover, we do not know the precise relationships through which HRM dedicated well-being practices, especially across organizational levels (e.g., hierarchies) and the social processes that may influence employee attitudes and behaviors and, ultimately, their performance (Boxall et al., 2011; Boxall & Purcell, 2011; Evans & Davis, 2005; Kehoe & Wright, 2013; Wright & Haggerty, 2005). Within this body of research, scholars have shown social processes such as perceived organizational support (Liao, Toya, Lepak, & Hong, 2009), relational coordination (Gittell & Douglass, 2012), and concern for employee climate (Takeuchi, Chen, & Lepak, 2009) can mediate the influence of HRM on a range of outcomes.

One other potentially fruitful approach to understanding the HRM performance link has been the mediating role of social climate (Chuang & Liao, 2010; Collins & Smith, 2006; Prieto & Santana, 2012). Social climate is defined as "the collective set of norms, values, and beliefs that express employees' views of how they interact with one another while carrying out tasks for the firm" (Collins & Smith, 2006, p. 547). Following Collins and Smith (2006), in this article, we characterize and operationalize social climate by trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language that exist among individuals within an organizational context. We draw on social information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) and the work of Schneider (1983) to argue shared perceptions provide powerful cues for individuals regarding appropriate and desired behavior, and performance expectations within an organizational setting. In line with Wright and Haggerty (2005) and Guest (2017), we argue well-being-oriented HRM practices may impact employee resilience through social mechanisms such as social climate, which promote trust and cooperation.

The continued interest in HRM-performance research is driven by increased global competition, technology advancement in the information age, and the increased provision of complex services and goods. Given this increase in competitive organizational pressures and fast-paced change in many organizations, particularly in service industries (e.g., the banking sector), many employees are faced with work intensification and increased pressure to meet targets, which may negatively impact their health, well-being, and job performance (Bardoel, Pettit, De Cieri, & McMillan, 2014; Cooke, Cooper, Bartram, Wang, & Mei, 2016). Consequently, there is a growing body of literature informed by positive psychology (Luthans, 2002a, Luthans, 2012) that suggests employee resilience, through HRM, may offer a

potential strategy for organizations to effectively manage and support their employees to overcome contemporary workplace challenges.

Resilience can be defined as the "developable capacity to rebound or bounce back from adversity, conflict, failure, or even positive events, progress, and increased responsibility" (Luthans, 2002b, p. 702). Despite its acknowledged importance, research on individual resilience in an organizational context remains limited (Stajkovic, 2006; Youssef & Luthans, 2005). Moreover, irrespective of calls for a positive psychological approach to managing human resources, few firms see resilience as something that can be developed proactively as part of HRM to improve individual well-being and performance (Wang, Cooke, & Huang, 2014). Few firms provide resilience training as skills and competencies to be developed or for that matter view the development of a resilient workforce through HRM practices as a means to compete in the marketplace (Cooke et al., 2016).

Similarly, despite the importance of a resilient workforce to support a sustainable workplace, particularly in highly competitive and complex service industries like banking, there remains limited knowledge about the relationships among well-being-oriented HRM practices, social climate, employee resilience, and employee performance. Based on an extensive literature search, the authors could not find any study that specifically empirically examined the impact of social climate on employee resilience. Following Prieto and Santana (2012), we examine the process through which well-being-oriented HRM practices impact the broader social context that shapes employee perceptions of social climate and its effect on their resilience. Using a multilevel approach, our study is the first to our knowledge to unpack the social mechanisms through which well-being-oriented HRM practices may support the development of resilience and subsequent employee (in-role or task) performance at the workplace, namely by influencing group feelings of social climate as operationalized through trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language that exist among individuals within an organization. We examine these relationships using positive psychology (Seligman, 2002) and positive organizational behavior (POB) approaches (Luthans, 2002a), given that they emphasize developing human resource strengths and psychological capacities of which employee well-being, resilience, and social connectivity are important concepts. This expands our understanding of the important role of resilience in the HRM-performance relationship.

As an empirical site for the study, the banking sector presents an ideal context to explore employee resilience and its relationship with well-being-oriented HRM practices. An essential component of a successful banking industry is the sustainable and effective management of its employees. However, heightened global competition and strategies adopted by banks are subjecting their employees to growing performance pressure, and therefore HRM practices that support employee well-being and their subsequent resilience may be an important path to meet performance expectations. Therefore, our study addresses a key question: how do well-being-oriented HRM practices impact banking employees' resilience and performance?

This study contributes to existing knowledge in three ways. First, we link well-being-oriented HRM practices, including training and development, job security, information sharing practices, supportive relationships with immediate managers, aspects of employee voice such as input into how work is performed, aspects of quality work

such as autonomy, and the use of teams, with the development of employee resilience. This is important given the growing recognition in the management and positive psychology literature of the challenges associated with employee well-being at the workplace and the need for HRM practices to enhance employee resilience through building HR strengths and psychological capacities (Luthans, 2002b). Second, we extend the theoretical frameworks in HRM, namely through a positive psychology perspective to examine empirically whether or how well-being-oriented HRM practices can be used to build a resilient workforce as a strategic vehicle to enhance the performance of employees through creating a "win-win situation." We do this using a social (i.e., social climate) lens (informed by social information processing theory), as well as a multilevel approach. Third, this study is innovative because we conceptualize employee resilience as a developable skill that can be impacted by management practices and social processes. Through a conceptualization of employee resilience as developable, we contribute to a better understanding of the multi-level processes through which well-being-oriented HRM practices can enhance employee resilience and contribute to employee performance.

## 2 | THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 | Well-being-oriented HRM practices

Despite the lack of agreement and continued debate regarding the "right" composition of strategic HRM bundles (Boxall & Purcell, 2011; Posthuma, Campion, Masimova, & Campion, 2013), it is widely accepted the components should be multiple and mutually reinforcing (Bartram, Karimi, Stanton, & Leggat, 2014; Zacharatos, Barling, & Iverson, 2005). Contemporary HRM research asserts that for HRM to be both ethical and sustainable, mutual gain must be created for both management and employees (Valizade, Ogbonnaya, Tregaskis, & Forde, 2016; Van de Voorde, Pauw, & van Veldhoven, 2012; Wood, van Veldhoven, Croon, & De Menezes, 2012). Research findings on the extent to which HRM and its various incarnations, that is, high-performance work systems (HPWSs), high-involvement work systems (HIWSs), or high-commitment work systems (HCWSs), promote individual performance at the expense of employee well-being are mixed (see Guest, 2017). For example, Jensen, Patel, and Messersmith (2013) reported HPWS was associated with work intensification, which in turn led to work-related stress. Moreover, Wood et al. (2012) found high-involvement work practices were associated with performance but negatively associated with employee well-being. Given the growing evidence of the economic, ethical, and health benefits of employee well-being at the workplace, we use Guest's (2017) well-being-oriented HRM approach to examine the process through which HRM practices impact employee performance. Guest (2017) suggests there are three main facets of well-being, which include psychological, physical, and social functioning. Guest develops a bundle of HRM practices that are likely to promote employee well-being. Guest's (2017) well-being-oriented HRM practices include investing in employees (e.g., training and development), providing engaging work (e.g., job designed to provide autonomy and challenge, information provision), a positive social and physical

environment (e.g., employment security and required and optional social interaction), voice (e.g., extensive two-way communication), and organizational support (e.g., participative and supportive management). Guest (2017) identifies a number of reasons why the earlier HRM practices will enhance employee well-being. First, improving employee knowledge, skills, and abilities through training and development, mentoring, and career support is critical to enhancing employee competence, security, and self-efficacy, which may thereby contribute to feelings of well-being. Second, organizations need to provide engaging work to enhance employees' autonomy, skill utilization, and task variety, which have been well documented to enhance employee well-being. Third, HRM practices should provide a positive social and physical environment through the provision of a safe work-place, employment security, and opportunities for social interactions. Fourth, HRM practices should also promote extensive two-way communication and opportunities for individuals to express their voice. Fifth, organizations need to develop HRM practices that promote organizational support including participative and supportive managers, which are well known in the quality of work-life literature to enhance employee well-being (Guest, 2017).

There is mounting evidence from positive psychology that positively developing HR strengths and psychological capacities are associated with employee well-being and subsequent performance (Youssef & Luthans, 2005). We draw upon positive psychology and POB to underpin our theoretical examination of how well-being-oriented HRM practices, through social climate, impact employee resilience and ultimately individual performance. Positive psychology is defined as "building the best qualities in life ... we must bring the building of strength to the forefront in the treatment and prevention of mental illness" (Seligman, 2002, p. 3). Luthans (2002a, p. 59) applies positive psychology to the workplace to develop POB, which is defined as "the study and application of positively oriented human resource strengths and psychological capacities that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed for performance improvement in today's workplace." Resilience and the process through which it is developed, according to Luthans, Vogelgesang, and Lester (2006), meet the POB criteria given they are positive and strength-based, underpinned by theory and research, and are state-like and developable (see later).

In this study, we consider a number of practices identified by Guest (2017) as representative of well-being-oriented HRM practices and associated with building employee resilience, especially within the Chinese banking sector (c.f., Bardoei et al., 2014; Cooke et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014). These practices comprise training and development/learning, use of teams, information sharing, job security, relationship with the immediate manager, and quality work (defined as appropriate workload, role clarity, and employee control). We select these particular well-being-oriented HRM practices because they are employee-oriented, relationship-building driven, with employees' development needs and well-being at heart. It is important to note there is evidence to suggest HRM practices, for example, those that promote employees perceiving work overload, pressure to work longer hours, and where managers place greater demand on their personal time, can lead to negative employee outcomes such as job stress (Macky & Boxall, 2008) and emotional exhaustion (Zhang, Zhu, Dowling, & Bartram, 2013). Bardoei et al. (2014) argue the aforementioned

HRM practices that promote employee resilience will “inoculate” employees against job stress and emotional exhaustion and promote employee well-being.

### 2.2 | Resilience

The concept of resilience emerged in the 1970s, initially in the clinical research context, and started to gain research attention in the organizational management field from the 1990s (e.g., Ollier-Malaterre, 2010; Robertson & Cooper, 2011). One main perspective in the research on individual resilience in the organizational context is related to the field of positive psychology, represented by Luthans and colleagues. Luthans (2002a, p. 59) considers resilience as one of the four components of psychological capital (PsyCap) (self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience), which can be “measured, developed, and effectively managed for performance improvement.” Resilience enables both recovery from negative events and proactive learning and growth for future challenges (Youssef & Luthans, 2005). Furthermore, Luthans, Avolio, Avey, and Norman (2007) suggest resilience is “state-like,” meaning that it is relatively malleable and open to development. According to Avey, Luthans, and Jensen (2009, p. 682), resilience is “arguably the most important positive resource for navigating a turbulent and stressful workplace.” A central argument here is the need for organizations to adopt a more positive approach to managing their human resources, through the proactive management of their psychological capital, instead of adopting a dominant negative perspective that focuses on occupational stress (Avey et al., 2009).

Both theory and prior research support our argument that resilience is developable, for example, through training and development (Luthans et al., 2007; Masten & Reed, 2002; Wang et al., 2014). There is substantial clinical research that has “established that both external (contextual) and internal (psychological) characteristics influence one’s capacity for resilience” (Luthans et al., 2006, p. 28). Masten’s (2001, p. 235) seminal study concludes that “resilience does not come from rare and special qualities, but from the everyday magic of ordinary, normative human resources ...This has profound implications for promoting competence and human capital in individuals and society.” Importantly, there is growing evidence of a demonstrable impact of resilience on performance at the workplace (e.g., Cooke et al., 2016; Coutu, 2002; Luthans et al., 2006).

### 2.3 | Well-being-oriented HRM and employee resilience

Recently, researchers have started to explore the relationship between HRM practices and the resilience of employees (e.g., Bardoei et al., 2014; Lengnick-Hall, Beck, & Lengnick-Hall, 2011; Luthans et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2014). Following Bardoei et al. (2014), we argue the effect of well-being-oriented HRM practices on employee resilience can be explained through positive psychology (Fredrickson, 2002; Luthans, 2002a; Luthans et al., 2006; Masten, 2001). Positive psychologists assert when developed and effectively managed, resilience skills can enhance individual responses to stressful and challenging circumstances (Youssef & Luthans, 2005). HRM may play a critical

role in developing employees’ resilience (Luthans, 2012; Moenke-meyer, Hoegl, & Weiss, 2012).

The use of HRM practices to develop resilience skills among employees may foster greater individual flexibility, persistence, and motivation in the face of complex, competitive, and dynamic environments (Luthans et al., 2007; Peterson, Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, & Zhang, 2011). Underpinned by the work of Masten (2001) and Fredrickson (2002), Luthans et al. (2006) put forward two approaches through which human resource development (HRD) may enable employee resilience: proactive and reactive approaches. These approaches are based on a proactive assessment of risks and personal assets that may impact an individual’s performance at the workplace. Masten (2001) argues as individuals increase their assets (e.g., well-being-oriented HRM practices and social capital through a strong social climate) they may perceive a decrease in their exposure to risk (e.g., fear of losing their job). Luthans et al. (2006) propose three areas of focus (i.e., risk, asset, and process strategies) for a proactive HRD approach. First, a proactive approach to building employee resilience through the reduction of risk and stress may mitigate the potential for adverse events. This may be achieved through developing a strong organizational culture created by “developing trust and reciprocity between the organization and its leadership and the employee employees” (Luthans et al., 2006, p. 33). We argue later well-being-oriented HRM practices such as supportive leadership, job security, and an extensive use of teams may facilitate a climate of trust and collaboration within the organization. Moreover, an asset-focused strategy that relies on enhancing individual and organizational resources is critical to developing both human and social capital (Luthans et al., 2006) and the subsequent resiliency of employees. We argue well-being-oriented HRM practices that emphasize training, development, and learning, as well as supportive leadership and information sharing, contribute to building individual and social capital in the workplace.

The reactive approach according to Luthans et al. (2006) draws from positive psychologist Fredrickson’s (2002) “broaden and build” model of positive emotions, which emphasizes positive thinking and finding meaning in negative events. Fredrickson (2002) argues positive emotions can be durable and may add to a “storehouse of personal assets,” which can then be relied upon when resilience is required. We argue well-being-oriented HRM practices can be used to build positive experiences for organizational members (e.g., a social climate of trust and collaboration) leading to increased thought-action skills, which may enhance resilience. Luthans et al. (2006, p. 37) suggest “getting employees to exhibit positive emotions and their ability to trigger an ‘upward-spiral’ that can increase their resilience would seem to be an effective reactive HRD strategy.” Well-being-oriented HRM practices that promote investing in employees, engaging work, positive social environment, employee voice, and organizational support mechanisms should also increase the development of employees’ perception of influence.

### 2.4 | Social climate

An important part of understanding employee resilience is considering the interaction between workers and their environment, particularly

social systems in which these workers operate (Coutu, 2002; Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011). Social context is "an integral ingredient enabling the kinds of behaviors and mental models that lead to resilience" (Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011, p. 247). The process of acquiring, transferring, and integrating valuable knowledge within organizations generally takes place through social interaction (Kang, Morris, & Snell, 2007; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). In the following discussion, we outline the process through which well-being-oriented HRM practices are likely to shape the development of social climate, which, in turn, may impact employee resilience.

Collins and Smith (2006, p. 547) define social climate as "the collective set of norms, values, beliefs that express employees' views of how they interact with one another while carrying out tasks for their firm." More broadly, social climate refers to the "network of relationships that exists among individuals in some group and to the assets that are mobilized through the network of social relationships" (Prieto & Santana, 2012, p. 193). Social climate is characterized by trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language that exist among individuals within an organization (c.f., Collins & Smith, 2006; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). In line with Collins and Smith (2006), we argue well-being-oriented HRM practices support the building of trust and cooperation and foster the commonality of purpose among managers and employees within organizations. Extant research has illustrated the additive effects of HRM on building social climate to facilitate knowledge exchange (Prieto & Santana, 2012) and the development of intellectual and social capital (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). These practices are likely to be valuable in the development of resilience as an ability or skill, as individuals learn not only through formalized and purposeful skills training but also through social interaction and cooperation with their colleagues and managers (Bartram et al., 2014).

Drawing from the earlier discussion, our multilevel conceptual model (see Figure 1), underpinned by positive psychology and a social relational perspective, provides an analytical approach to understand how relationships between well-being-oriented HRM practices and individual performance outcomes are transmitted in turn through social climate and employee resilience.

## 3 | HYPOTHESES

### 3.1 | Well-being-oriented HRM and social climate

We contend well-being-oriented HRM practices can be instrumental in the development of a social climate based on shared cognitions,

trust, and cooperative networks among employees and managers (Collins & Smith, 2006). The relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate can be explained through social information processing theory (Aryee, Walumbwa, Seidu, & Otaye, 2012; Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). Salancik and Pfeffer (1978) argue the social environment provides cues that individuals may use to construct and interpret events regarding desirable organizational attitudes and behaviors. The social context provides a construction of meaning through which organizations promote socially acceptable attitudes and behaviors. The use of HRM by managers provides a contextual cue for employees that enable them to psychologically interpret their work environment (Aryee et al., 2012). HRM practices enable managers to focus employees' attention on critical information and associated desired behavior and its consequences. For example, well-being-oriented HRM practices (such as information sharing, a positive relationship with the immediate manager, team work, and quality work) may build a social climate of trust and cooperation and facilitate knowledge exchange and human capital development that enhance employees' resilience.

Well-being-oriented HRM practices, especially through enhancing employee knowledge, skills and abilities, engaging work, a positive social environment, and supportive leadership, are likely to increase the norms of cooperation by emphasizing the importance of individual effort toward the achievement of group goals. This may increase the prevalence of shared values and common purpose among managers and employees (Collins & Smith, 2006). Building shared codes and language through HRM practices that encourage employee voice and management support of employees is important within organizations to enhance individuals' ability to communicate more effectively (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998) and consequently the social network (Youssef & Luthans, 2005). Semiautonomous work teams may also facilitate the development of trust through the improvement of a shared cognitive ability in which individuals' self-efficacy and perceived self-efficacy of others are increased (Bonnano, 2005). This creates a greater opportunity for communication and interaction between managers and employees within the organization, further supporting the development of trust through strong social networks (Collins & Smith, 2006; Luthans et al., 2006). Well-being-oriented HRM practices such as training and development as well as internal social events may facilitate the development of shared codes and language (Collins & Smith, 2016). Moreover, shared codes and language are likely to be improved by creating greater opportunities for communication, interdependent and frequent interactions (Gagné, 2009),

knowledge sharing among individuals (Zacharatos et al., 2005), and support of one another (Collins & Smith, 2006).

Previous empirical research has demonstrated HRM practices are positively associated with social climate. Collins and Smith's (2006) study specifically highlighted trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language as the key dimensions of social climate. Collins and Smith (2006) found commitment-oriented HRM practices were positively associated with the three aforementioned dimensions of social climate. In addition, Prieto and Santana (2012) reported high-involvement HRM practices were positively associated with social climate within organizations.

Based on theory and previous research, we propose the following hypothesis:

**Hypothesis 1:** Well-being-oriented HRM practices are positively related to social climate.

### 3.2 | Well-being-oriented HRM-social climate-employee resilience

We propose social climate may act as an important conduit for well-being-oriented HRM practices to impact employee resilience. As noted earlier, well-being-oriented HRM practices are likely to be more important in building a social climate of trust and cooperation. This process may support an employees' ability to exchange and combine information, which in turn may increase their personal assets and resiliency (Masten, 2001; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). Trust and cooperation within organizations may increase the likelihood of information, knowledge, and ideas sharing among employees. Shared codes and language may facilitate information and knowledge exchange (Collins & Smith, 2006) and the building of social capital (Luthans et al., 2006). This theorizing lays the basis through which social climate may influence the development of employee resilience. Social climate may also be associated with creating a sense of meaning through a strong value system (Coutu, 2002). High levels of trust between employees' and their immediate manager may be an important antecedent to employee resilience. We suggest that employees who trust their colleagues and managers who they deem capable and skilled are more likely to feel supported, able to get assistance, and be treated fairly (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Positive interactions at work and improved relationships contribute to increased personal assets, and possibly perceived risk mitigation and ultimately resilience (Masten, 2001).

Lengnick-Hall et al. (2011) argue HR principles that encourage social interactions within the organization, such as nurturing a climate of reciprocal trust and interdependence, and organizational citizenship, may facilitate greater employee resilience. Moreover, broad resource networks associated with social climate enable individuals to develop relationships with one another to share critical resources such as employee resilience skills and strategies (Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

**Hypothesis 2:** Social climate mediates the relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience.

### 3.3 | Employee resilience and employee performance

Avey, Reichard, Luthans, and Mhatre (2011) argue resilience may motivate employees to exert additional effort to succeed, which, in turn, may increase performance. An extensive literature search has revealed very little research on the relationship between employee resilience and performance (Luthans et al., 2010). However, Luthans and colleagues examine the impact of PsyCap more broadly on employee attitudinal and behavioral outcomes including employee performance (Avey et al., 2011; Luthans, Avolio, Walumbwa, & Li, 2005; Luthans et al., 2010).

In the face of adversity and setbacks, resilient employees tend to respond positively and with perseverance (Avey et al., 2011; Peterson et al., 2011). This argument not only applies to the Western context, but also in the Chinese setting. For example, Luthans et al. (2005) reported a positive relationship between the resilience of Chinese workers who were undergoing substantial organizational changes and their performance. In light of this research, we argue employee resilience may act as a conduit between social climate and employee performance. We hypothesize:

**Hypothesis 3:** Employee resilience is positively related to employee performance.

**Hypothesis 4:** Employee resilience mediates the relationship between social climate and employee performance.

## 4 | METHOD

### 4.1 | Sample and procedure

The data of this article are drawn from a survey conducted in 62 bank branches of 16 banks during 2014–2015 in Chengdu and Chongqing, two major cities in the southwestern region of China. These two cities were chosen because they are highly populated strategic regional capitals for regional development with a strong finance sector. They are also less well covered by research studies of HRM in China, which have thus far focused primarily on the more developed eastern regions (Cooke, 2009; Wang et al., 2014). Access to the bank branches to conduct the surveys was gained through institutional and personal networks. The branches were selected to represent different districts in each city, but there was a relatively high concentration in the city center and commercially active areas. This choice of locations reflects the fact that these areas are busier with higher levels of customer flows, higher levels of transaction activities, and therefore higher levels of performance pressure and employee resilience required to deal with these work situations.

We collected survey data from two sources (branch managers and their employees) and with temporal separation across two time points (6 months) to minimize the risk of common method variance (CMV) (Podsakoff, McKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2012). The questionnaires were designed by the research team in English and then translated into Chinese and back into English by the bilingual members of the

team and two independent researchers, using the back-translation procedure (Brisin, 1970). To ensure the measures were culturally valid and reliable, a pilot was conducted with 40 bank employees and four bank managers in December 2014. The questionnaires were then modified and finalized to ensure the expression of each question could be easily and correctly understood by the respondents. This pre-test also allowed us to obtain insights into employees' resilience and HR practice of the banking industry in China and provide an assessment of the items' face validity and likely reliability of the data that would be collected (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2003).

In the first wave (conducted in December, 2014), each branch manager was given 15 paper-based questionnaires (with a return envelope) and asked to distribute them to their employees randomly. We provided 15 questionnaires even though most of the teams supervised by a particular supervisor/manager in a branch were smaller than that. In many teams, most of, if not all, the team members available would have filled in the questionnaire. Each employee was allowed 30 min to complete the questionnaire during their work time. Employees were asked to put their completed questionnaire in the envelope provided and seal it. The researchers went to each site to collect the completed employee questionnaires 2 weeks after they were distributed.

In the second wave, 6 months after the first wave, paper-based questionnaires (with a return envelope inside) were distributed to the 62 managers to obtain their ratings of the surveyed employees' performance. Both the employee and manager questionnaires were coded to ensure their responses could be matched. The researchers went to each site to collect the completed manager questionnaires a week after they were distributed. All participants were assured their responses were confidential and were informed of the voluntary nature of participation.

In all, 561 matched employee-manager responses were received from the 62 branches (an average of approximately 9 employees per branch). These 561 matched employee-manager responses represent an overall response rate of 95%. This high response rate was achieved for several reasons. First, there are good institutional and personal connections with the bank branches participating in the study. Second, one of the authors went to each of these bank branches with a research assistant and explained carefully the purpose and requirements of the study and its benefits to the bank. Third, reminders were sent to the managers responsible for collecting the questionnaires. In some cases, the researchers, when they went to the branch to collect the returned questionnaires, waited for the remaining employees and the manager to complete their questionnaires to ensure a high response rate.

Of the 561 employees, just over half (53%) were female and most (85%) were aged under 30 years. The mean hours worked per normal week were reported to be 45.43 (SD = 7.33, median = 45). The mean organizational tenure was 5.06 years (SD = 5.84, median = 3).

### 4.2 | Measures

Well-being-oriented HRM practices were measured with employee ratings. Specifically, as noted earlier, we focused on the following six dimensions that capture well-being-oriented HRM practices drawn from the work of Zacharatos et al. (2005): *employment security* (five

items, e.g., "This branch provides me with job security"); *training and development/learning* (five items, e.g., "This branch has provided me with training opportunities enabling me to extend my range of skills and abilities"); *job quality* (five items, e.g., "Fostering involvement in decision-making at all levels of this branch is important"); *information sharing* (six items, e.g., "Information about how well my branch is doing financially is shared with me"); *use of teams* (five items, e.g., "My branch places a great deal of importance on team development"); and *relationship with immediate manager* (five items, e.g., "My immediate manager encourages me to express my ideas and opinions"). Employees rated each of the 31 items on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Following other studies (e.g., Kehoe & Wright, 2013), we created an additive index by summing the 31 items. The resulting index, which ranges from 31 to 155, measures employees' perceptions of the extent to which well-being-oriented HRM practices are present in the branch. The use of an additive approach is consistent with the arguments of Youndt, Snell, Dean, and Lepak (1996) that organizations can improve performance either by increasing the number of HRM practices they employ or by using the practices in a more widespread manner. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the measure was .89.

*Social climate* was measured using the 10-item scale developed by Prieto and Santana (2012). An example item is "Employees in the branch share a commonality of purpose and collective aspirations with others at work." Employees rated each item on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Higher scores indicate a more positive social climate. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the scale was .94.

*Employee resilience* was measured using the 3-item resilience subscale from the PsyCap Questionnaire (PCQ 12), which is an abridged version of the original scale developed by Luthans et al. (2007). Employees rated the three items on a 6-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the scale was .76.

*Employee (in-role) performance* was measured using the 7-item scale developed by Williams and Anderson (1991). An example item is "This person adequately completes assigned duties." Managers rated their subordinates for each of the items on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the scale was .86.

*Control variables*: We included employee age (coded on a 6-point ordinal scale from 1 = <25 years to 6 = 65 years and over), gender (coded 1 = male, 0 = female), and hours worked per normal week as controls in line with previous research (Cooke et al., 2016). We did not control for organizational tenure as it was highly correlated with age ( $r = .73$ ). We also controlled for branch size in our analyses (Liao et al., 2009).

### 4.3 | Method of analysis

The present dataset was multilevel in nature, consisting of 561 employees nested within 62 bank branches, which, in turn, were nested within 16 banks. Hence, multilevel modeling using Mplus 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles, CA, USA) with robust maximum likelihood estimation was used with random intercepts specified at both

branch and bank levels. We followed the procedures for testing cross-level mediation with a participant-level mediator as outlined in Pituch and Stapleton (2012). To test the hypothesized indirect (mediated) effect, we used a Monte Carlo simulation with the recommended 20,000 random replications (Preacher & Selig, 2012). A Monte Carlo simulation is a flexible and powerful method of constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for indirect effects, as it can be used where bootstrapping is not feasible, such as with multilevel data.

## 5 | RESULTS

### 5.1 | Construct validity

To test construct validity, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the measures of well-being-oriented HRM practices (specified as a higher-order factor), social climate, employee resilience, and employee performance was conducted. We used robust maximum likelihood estimation for the CFA as it is robust to nonnormality and nonindependence of observations (Rhemtulla, Brosseau-Liard, & Savalei, 2012). The hypothesized 4-factor CFA yielded an acceptable fit to the data  $\chi^2$  (df = 293) = 729; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .05; Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) = .90; Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .91. A 3-factor model combining well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate yielded a poorer fit to the data  $\chi^2$  (df = 296) = 1,007; RMSEA = .07; TLI = .84; and CFI = .85, as did a 3-factor model combining social climate and employee resilience,  $\chi^2$  (df = 296) = 943; RMSEA = .06; TLI = .85; and CFI = .87. Finally, a 1-factor measurement model (where all indicators loaded onto a single factor) resulted in a very poor fit,  $\chi^2$  (df = 299) = 2,150; RMSEA = .11; TLI = .58; and CFI = .62. Taken together, these results provide good evidence for construct validity of the measures used in this study.

### 5.2 | Aggregation tests

As noted earlier, we conceptualized well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate as collectively experienced or shared constructs at the group (branch) level. We use this approach given the evidence to suggest single-source responses from HR managers, particularly when gathered at the corporate level, may be unreliable (e.g., Chang, 2005; Takeuchi et al., 2009) and HR managers may

overstate the use of HRM practices within their organization (Ostroff & Bowen, 2016). Furthermore, Kehoe and Wright (2013) argue an effective HRM creates a collective or a group understanding of HRM practices. Moreover, for individual and organizational performance to be enhanced, HRM theory requires consistency of employees' perceptions and similar reactions to HRM practices as implemented at the group level (Kehoe & Wright, 2013).

Hence, we examined whether well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate were appropriate for consideration as branch-level constructs. The mean within-group measure of agreement (as measured by rwg and assuming a uniform null distribution) for the well-being-oriented HRM practices scale was .98 and .97 for the social climate scale, exceeding the recommended .70 cutoff value and indicating a high level of within-group agreement (LeBreton & Senter, 2008). The intraclass correlation (ICC1) values (which measure the proportion of between group variation) for well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate were .21 and .20, respectively. The ICC2 values (which measure the reliability of the aggregated group means) for well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate were .72 and .71, respectively. Taken together, these results show there is a reliable variation across branches and sufficient within-group agreement to aggregate well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate scores to the branch level.

### 5.3 | Multilevel modeling

Table 1 presents the means, SDs, and correlations of the study variables. Correlations among the study variables were in the expected direction. Prior to conducting our analyses, it was necessary to demonstrate sufficient between-group variance in the dependent variables (employee resilience and performance) to justify multilevel modeling. The ICC1 values at the branch level were .19 for employee resilience and .36 for employee performance, respectively. The ICC1 values at the bank level were .05 for employee resilience and .21 for employee performance, respectively. It is important to note that ICC1 values as small as .05 can significantly bias SEs in regression analyses that fail to take into account the nonindependence (or clustering) of observations (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). The ICC1 of .36, for employee performance at the branch level, represents a large effect by conventional standards (LeBreton & Senter, 2008) and indicates that 36% of the variance in performance ratings was between branches and 64%

within branches. Despite the relatively large amount of between-branch variance, we conceptualize employee performance as a lower-level dependent variable, as it can vary both within and across groups (e.g., branches) and our multilevel analyses partition and model the variance at these levels.

Hypothesis 1 predicted well-being-oriented HRM practices are positively related to social climate, both operationalized at the branch level. As noted earlier, we collected data from two sources and with a 6-month temporal separation between employee performance and the remaining variables to minimize the risk of CMV. Nevertheless, in a multilevel study, aggregate-level correlations can still be impacted by shared biases (Ostroff, Kinicki, & Clark, 2002). Hence, following Ostroff et al. (2002), we split the samples into half when computing the aggregate correlations. Specifically, we randomly selected 50% of employees within each branch to construct the well-being-oriented HRM practices scores for each of the branches, and the remaining 50% provided the social climate scores. Using this aggregate-split level procedure and controlling for the branch size, there was a positive relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate ( $\beta = .31, p < .01$ ). Hence, Hypothesis 1 was supported.

Having established well-being-oriented HRM practices were positively associated with social climate, we examined which of the six dimensions was most influential in that relationship. In order of magnitude, we found relationship with immediate manager ( $\beta = .28, p < .01$ ), followed by information sharing ( $\beta = .25, p < .01$ ) and job security ( $\beta = .25, p < .01$ ), use of teams ( $\beta = .22, p < .01$ ), training and development/learning ( $\beta = .21, p < .01$ ), and job quality ( $\beta = .19, p < .01$ ).

Table 2 presents the results from the multilevel regression analyses that tested Hypotheses 2–4 (see also Figure 2 for a summary). There was a positive cross-level relationship between social climate and employee resilience ( $\beta = .14, p < .01$ ). Hypothesis 2 predicted social climate mediates the relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience. A Monte Carlo CI for the standardized indirect effect of well-being-oriented HRM practices on employee resilience though social climate was .04 (95% CI = .01 to .08). As zero is not contained in the 95% CI for the indirect effect, Hypothesis 2 was supported.

Hypothesis 3 predicted employee resilience is positively related to employee performance. As shown in Table 2 (Model 2), in support of Hypothesis 3, there was a positive relationship between employee resilience and employee performance,  $\beta = .14, p < .05$ . Note as we collected data for employee resilience and employee performance at two separate time points and from two sources of data, this strengthens our confidence that resilience is an antecedent of employee performance.

Finally, Hypothesis 4 predicted employee resilience mediates the relationship between social climate and employee performance. A Monte Carlo CI for the standardized indirect effect of social climate on employee performance via resilience was .02 (95% CI = .01 to .05). As zero is not contained in the 95% CI for the indirect effect, Hypothesis 4 was supported. After controlling for social climate, there was a positive direct relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience ( $\beta = .19, p < .01$ ). This finding of partial mediation suggests social climate is not the only mechanism through which well-being-oriented HRM practices can influence employee

Although inferences of complete mediation must be made with caution, the direct effect of well-being-oriented HRM practices on employee performance was not statistically significant ( $\beta = .01, p > .05$ ; see Model 2), and nor was the effect of social climate on employee performance ( $\beta = .12, p > .05$ ), suggesting full mediation.

## 6 | DISCUSSION

This study examined the relationships among well-being-oriented HRM practices, social climate, employee resilience, and employee (in-role) performance. Overall, the results provide support for our hypotheses. First, consistent with Hypothesis 1, we found a positive relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate. Second, consistent with Hypothesis 2, social climate (partially) mediated the relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience. Third, consistent with Hypothesis 3 we found a positive relationship between employee resilience and employee performance. Finally, we found support for Hypothesis 4, that is employee resilience (fully) mediated the relationship between social climate and employee performance.

### 6.1 | Theoretical contributions

This study makes a number of related contributions. First, our study identifies a key social mechanism through which well-being-oriented HRM practices support the development of resilience at the workplace, namely through influencing group feelings of social climate as related to trust, cooperation, and commonality of purpose by organizational participants. We built on previous work of social processes as mediating mechanisms (Collins & Smith, 2006; Liao et al., 2009; Takeuchi et al., 2009) by examining how social processes (e.g., social climate) affect employee resilience. There is some emerging but limited evidence that employee resilience can be developed through not only training interventions (Luthans et al., 2010) but also socially through the use of teams, information sharing, and supportive

leadership (Cooke et al., 2016). Unpacking the link between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee performance through social climate and resilience is important given the evidence HRM practices affect employees' knowledge, skills, and abilities and attitudes not only through individual but also through social mechanisms (Bartram et al., 2014; Evans & Davis, 2005; Kehoe & Wright, 2013; Wright & Haggerty, 2005). This expands our understanding of valuable new mediators in the HRM-performance relationship.

Second, we have highlighted resilience as an important construct in both the HRM literature and practice by demonstrating employee resilience is positively associated with employee performance. Our results support the efficacy of positive psychology to explain how HRM affects employee resilience in that well-being-oriented HRM practices are associated with employees' resiliency assets or resources (Bardoel et al., 2014; Luthans et al., 2006). In line with Luthans et al. (2010), our findings suggest resilient employees may increase their performance through enhanced social capital and personal assets associated with well-being-oriented HRM practices and a positive social climate.

Third, our study responds to the call for multilevel and multi-source research design and data collection (e.g., Guest & Conway, 2011) by aggregating employee responses to well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate to give a more realistic account of the overall nature of these constructs. We demonstrated multilevel analysis is a fruitful approach to examining responses to well-being-oriented HRM practices across organizational hierarchies. In addition, we minimized potential CMV by using supervisor ratings of subordinate performance and the use of temporal separation, as well as through the use of an aggregate-split level approach (Ostroff et al., 2002; Podsakoff et al., 2012).

### 6.2 | Practical implications

Findings from our study have a number of practical implications for organizations within and beyond the banking industry. Specifically, our study demonstrates the importance of an approach informed by positive psychology and implementing well-being-oriented HRM practices to develop and support a resilient workforce. Our approach primarily focuses on enhancing employee resilience through a systematic day-to-day well-being-oriented HRM system, rather than through formal micro-level training interventions as used by other authors such as Luthans et al. (2010). By unpacking the complex social processes through which well-being-oriented HRM practices impact social climate, employee resilience, and employee performance, our study helps identifying needs for development and other organizational

support beneficial to improving employee well-being and performance. We found, of the well-being-oriented HRM practices examined, the relationship with immediate manager was most strongly related to social climate, followed by information sharing, job security, use of teams, training and development/learning, and job quality. Having a resilient workforce is crucial to enhancing organizational competitiveness in an era of intensifying global competition, particularly in the banking sector where both work pressure and customer expectations are rising, leading to relatively high levels of burnout and staff turnover (e.g., Hunter & Katz, 2012). By understanding the process through which well-being-oriented HRM practices may impact employee resilience and subsequently employee performance, we are able to provide guidance to banks and possibly other service-based industries on their strategic HRM to achieve sustainable performance through enhanced employee resilience. To build a resilient workforce, managers need to consider building the strengths and psychological capacities of organizational participants through well-being-oriented HRM practices, as well as the ensuring development of trust, cooperation, and shared codes of conduct (Collins & Smith, 2006; Luthans, 2002a; Luthans et al., 2006). It is through this process that we argue well-being-oriented HRM practices may enhance employee resilience. We tentatively suggest other organizations, their managers, and employees operating in intense competitive or stressful and challenging work environments such as health care (e.g., doctors and nurses), first responders (e.g., police), and education (e.g., teachers) can learn from our findings. Given the challenges of job stress, burnout, and employee retention (Bartram et al., 2014) among these occupational groups and industries, managing employee resilience may be a fruitful approach.

### 6.3 | Limitations and future directions

Our study has several potential limitations. First, we examined well-being-oriented HRM practices in our research. These employee-centered HRM practices may have more positive impact than those that are organization-centered. As some HRM practices may have negative impact on, or are harmful to, employee well-being (e.g., Macky & Boxall, 2008; Mariappanadar, 2012), future studies may adopt different types of HRM practices to assess their effects. Second, an important area for future research is to develop and validate comprehensive multi-item measures of well-being-oriented HRM practices to complement those used in the present study. Third, although we measured employee performance at a different point in time from the antecedent variables, to fully ascertain whether social climate and resilience mediates the relationship between well-being-

oriented HRM practices and employee performance, future research might seek to use a cross-lagged panel design or consider experimental designs. Fourth, our study focused on a relatively young group of workers (i.e., 85% were below 30 years of age). A number of studies have found individuals' work-related motives may change with age and the effect of HRM practices may vary with age (e.g., Kooij et al., 2013). Given that several of the well-being-oriented HRM practices we selected for this study are development oriented, the effect of these may not be as strong on older workers. Therefore, it is important for future research to examine the strength of each of these well-being-oriented HRM practices, and other HRM practices, to assess the impact of the well-being-oriented HRM practices → resilience → performance chain on older workers as their life goals and ability change. This will enable us to identify types of development-oriented HRM practices that are appropriate for workers of different age groups. Fifth, this study focused on a single industry in one region in one country; it is unclear the extent to which our findings may be generalizable to other industries and regions in China and other national contexts. Future research can expand the scope of this study through multi-industry and cross-country comparative analysis to shed light on the multilevel HRM processes and the likely impacts of specific HRM practices. Finally, holding constant social climate, we found a positive direct relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience. This finding of partial mediation suggests social climate is not the only process through which well-being-oriented HRM practices can influence employee resilience. Future studies may wish to examine alternative mechanisms between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience, for example, the role of psychological empowerment and social identification as mediators (Bartram et al., 2014). In addition, a promising area for future research could be to examine related components of psychological capital (e.g., self-efficacy, hope, optimism) and/or employees' psychological, social, and physical well-being as mediators of the relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and performance (both in-role and extra-role), and the potential organizational boundary conditions of these relationships (Guest, 2017).

## 7 | CONCLUSION

This study advances our knowledge of the HRM performance chain and highlights the important role of well-being-oriented HRM practices as a tool to create sustainable workplaces. We drew upon positive psychology and a social relational perspective to conduct a multilevel and multisource study in the context of the Chinese banking industry. The findings show there is a positive relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and social climate; social climate mediates the relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee resilience; and there is a positive relationship between resilience and employee performance; employee resilience, in turn, mediates the relationship between social climate and employee performance. Our study has implications for firms that wish to build their sustainable competitiveness through well-being-oriented HRM practices to enhance levels of employee resilience and subsequent performance.
