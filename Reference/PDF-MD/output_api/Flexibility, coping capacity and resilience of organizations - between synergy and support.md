## Abstract

**Purpose** – The purpose of this paper is to study the following related terms: flexibility, resilience and coping capacity, in order to clarify relationships between them.

**Design/methodology/approach** – Methods applied in the study include the analysis and synthesis of scientific literature and a critical discussion considering provided references. By drawing on the notion of the ladder of abstraction, conceptual differences between the three terms are proposed.

**Findings** – Based on the most common associations of the terms in the literature, the paper proposes the following relationships between the terms: flexibility is most commonly associated with the inherent property of systems, which allows them to change within pre-established parameters; resilience is the ability of organizations to withstand changes in their environment and still function; coping capacity commonly refers to organizational behavior involving timely purposeful change.

**Practical implications** – As managers strive to improve the performance of their organizations in turbulent conditions, the paper provides a useful enhanced understanding of the relative roles that flexibility, resilience and coping capacity play in changes and maintaining the continuity of the organization.

**Originality/value** – While confusion between the meanings of these terms has been noted by various authors, the paper is believed to be the first to discuss the three terms in conjunction and thereby propose relationships between them. The proposed framework overcomes existing definitional fragmentation and raises awareness in the conceptualization of terms: flexibility, coping capacity and resilience. We contribute to extant business and management literature by proposing a model indicating the relationships between them.

## Introduction

The economic imperative to build businesses and organizations, which are more resilient to hazards, was clearly illustrated by the September 11th attacks, where business interruption losses far exceeded the sum of all property losses (Munich, 2001). However, such a need results not only from events of terrorist character. After the 1989 San Francisco Bay Earthquake, it is estimated that 50% of small businesses directly affected were permanently disabled, with the resulting job losses significantly impacting the economy of the area (EPICC, 2003). Having more resilient organizations is a key component toward achieving more resilient communities because it is organizations that deliver essential services and provide employment for a part of the community. The phenomenon of the resistance of the organization was already examined in different frames, taking into account covering the management of a sub-set of assets being human resources (Lengnick-Hall *et al.*, 2011), a focus on reducing vulnerabilities by reducing the propensity to disruptive events (Sheffi, 2005), focus on cognitive frameworks for adapting to environmental conditions (Watts and Paciga, 2011) and the desirability of various dynamic states (Limnios *et al.*, 2014). These works consider resistance as an independent, dynamic ability of the organization, allowing it to

survive under turbulent conditions. Coping capacity and flexibility were viewed in a similar manner. However, the review of the management literature indicates an inconsistency and ambiguity regarding the use of these constructs. They are often used interchangeably with the terms agility and anticipatory adaptation. Therefore, it is not clear whether resilience, flexibility, and coping capacity constitute synonyms or distinctly individual concepts. The failure regarding the explanation of interrelationships among these constructs may lead to different conclusions without theory guiding the progress of practice. In the present paper, we make an attempt to examine the relations between the resistance of the organization, its flexibility and coping capacity. Specifically, we call for developing these capabilities together at the organizational level. However, the paper has a conceptual character, and it is based on the following consolidated theories: resource-based theory and contingency theory. This study departs from the critical issues in extant reviews and literature, and contributes to the ongoing debate on resilience, flexibility and coping capacity in the business and management area by answering the following research question: whether and in what way the resilience is connected with the flexibility and coping capacity of the organization? In doing so, we conducted a systematic literature review of articles published between 2000 and 2018, critically analyzed the selected publications by means of inductive content analysis (Krippendorff, 2012). To provide deeper insight into the functioning of those capabilities, we merge findings from different research areas (e.g., business continuity management, crisis management, innovation management). Beyond that, we highlight important relationships and interactions of terms: coping capacity, flexibility and resilience. The result of this process is an informed, conceptual framework that fosters a comprehensive understanding of the relationships. Furthermore, the framework can serve as a basis for the operationalization of those constructs.

The paper is structured as follows. First, we illustrate the research methodology describing our literature selection criteria and data analysis protocol. Then, we present the main findings from analysis three terms (constructs) separately and analysis of interrelations between them. Finally, we discuss the conceptual framework with a set of propositions and offer future research avenues.

## Research methodology

As discussed in the introduction, we aim to identify relationships between flexibility, coping capacity, and resilience. In order to arrive at the objective, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and a systematic examination of research papers. We followed the research protocol depicted in Figure 1 (based on Tranfield et al., 2003).

Initially, we defined research questions. To do this, we conducted a preliminary search for organizational resilience, flexibility, and coping capacity. Based on this search, we acknowledged that, in order to understand studies' dependencies better, we needed to examine what we know and what we do not know about the following questions: (1) How are flexibility, resilience, and coping capacity conceptualized at the organizational level?, and (2) What are the dependencies that exist between them? In the second step, we defined the scope of our research. We are interested in the study of resilience in management at the organizational level. Therefore, we included the fields of management and business. We discarded psychology and human resources because the study of resilience in these fields is mainly focused on the resilience of individuals. In the third step, we defined the search criteria and selected a database in which to search. Articles were searched by using the keywords "flexibility" and "resilience," and "coping capacity" and "management" and "organization/business." Thereafter, the contents of these papers were critically analyzed by studying their abstract and introduction. We considered six databases: Elsevier Freedom Collection ([www.sciencedirect.com](#)), ScienceDirect, Scopus, Emerald Management 120, DOAJ Directory of Open Access Journals and EBSCO

1. Step 1. Defining research questions
2. Step 2. Defining boundaries
3. Step 3. Defining search criteria
   - database selection
   - search boundaries
   - search terms
4. Step 4. Defining exclusion criteria
5. Step 5. Validating search results
6. Step 6. Including additional papers
7. Step 7. Analyzing selected papers

Academic Search Complete ([www.ebsco.com](http://www.ebsco.com)). The time range of the analysis covered the years 2000–2018.

In the fourth step, we defined the exclusion criteria. We refined our results based on the papers' keywords and the analysis of their titles and abstracts. We excluded all the papers whose titles or abstracts were not related to organizational resilience, flexibility, coping capacity, and management. We realized that there were papers, which did not include a keyword section, and also papers that did not relate to economic and management sciences. In the fifth step, we replicated the search to validate our results. Finally, we analyzed all the papers. During this step, we realized that some cited relevant papers did not appear in our search because of the content or publication data. Therefore, we added these papers, as well. Finally, 85 papers were found to be relevant within the scope and boundary of the research. Thus, these papers were selected for further review. The identified contributions are listed in Appendix 1 and in the reference list.

### Category selection

The choice of the category was dictated by selected theoretical concepts. Therefore the papers on flexibility, organizational resilience, and coping capacity were identified. An additional category was articles combining the above concepts. Under each structural category, several distinct theoretical approaches were defined. A revised loop was used for continuous revision of approaches whenever there was overlap among the categories.

## Content evaluation

We evaluated the collected articles to determine the relevant contextual issues and research trends and to draw conclusions. In the subsequent sections, the detailed issues of each category are described as a result of the analysis of the collected materials.

### *The rigor of research methodology*

In content analysis, trustworthiness is one of the main challenges. This indicates whether the research is valid and relevant, and whether the procedures being followed are genuine or not. In this review paper, a right and focused procedure for the relevant data collection method has been followed. In addition to the authors, one more independent research assistant was also deployed by the authors to carry out this research on the lines as defined and used by the authors. It was observed that there was no significant difference in the research outcomes.

## **Coping capacity – organizational perspective**

Coping capacities are defined as the means by which people or organizations use available resources, skills and opportunities to face adverse consequences, which could lead to a disaster (IPCC, 2012), UNISDR (2009) defined coping capacity as the ability of people, organizations and systems, using available skills and resources, to face and manage adverse conditions, emergencies or disasters. Coping capacity captures the characteristics of an organization, which allow it to anticipate, act, achieve goals and manage resources (Wisner *et al.*, 2004) or which are associated with absorptive capacity and mobilization when a hazardous event occurs (Cutter *et al.*, 2008). This involves resource management to cope with hazards before, during and after they occur. Hertin *et al.* (2003) identified that this feature is related to an awareness of the need to adapt, the ability to make decisions regarding, which measures to implement, and the capacity to implement and control the process of adaptation. The term “capacity” refers to the potential to reduce and adapt to risk. In other words, it goes beyond institutionally based measures and people’s local coping strategies that are already in place; it also includes capacity that may be used in the future to reduce and adapt to risk. Hence coping capabilities can be separated into two subcategories: the ability to accept a problem and the ability to develop and implement solutions (Jaques, 2007). These capabilities imply immediate or short-term action in response to unexpected events (Madni and Jackson, 2009).

The literature of the subject frequently identifies coping capacity with the concept of adaptive capacity. Even though some authors have used them interchangeably, these are different concepts (Gallopín, 2006). Vogel and O’Brien (2004) underline that coping capacity can be viewed as a short-term approach dealing with capacities and survival in the light of extreme events, as well as the protection and conservation of the current system and institutional settings (see also Birkmann, 2013). In contrast, adaptive capacity as a constantly unfolding, progressive and long-term process of learning, experimentation and change, requires planned and strategic actions (Vogel and O’Brien, 2004) and modifications in behavior (Eriksen *et al.*, 2010). These notions differ in the temporal range of the adaptation, as well as the character of the reaction (active-reactive).

Coping capacity allows to maintain an acceptable level of results without making significant internal changes. Therefore, turbulence does not affect the efficiency or time of completing tasks. In order to be used, it requires the ability to recognize that certain actions are necessary for response to external turbulences. Coping capacity refers to the area in which deviations of actual results from expected results emerge. In Figure 2, baseline performance, i.e. a performance that would survive were it not for turbulences, was marked with a blue line. The shaded area indicates a range of values with an acceptable level. The ability to respond concerns the difference between the baseline and actual performance over time. In the first phase of the turbulence, the detection of the turbulence is emphasized. Coping capacity starts with accepting the problem. During this period, the results may or may not change. After the turbulence has been recognized, its nature must be determined and understood in the sense that the organization must determine whether the response is required, and if so, which type of response will be the most optimal. Going from detection to decision constitutes a sense-making phase. The search for a solution in the face of a crisis always constitutes a

combination of sense-making and acting. Sense-making emphasizes that people try to make things rationally accountable to themselves and others. Only if people understand the crisis situation, they are able to act on this. For an effective sense-making, there must be a continual feedback between understanding and action, i.e. sense must continually be made and remade. When a decision or a series of decisions are taken, they should be implemented, where the implementation time is a function of the complexity of the actions and the conditions for their implementation. In turn, the time required to return to an acceptable level of results depends on the type of turbulence and resistance of the organization.

Organizations can cope with turbulences in various ways, including the application of existing available responses to address changing conditions (e.g. in an extreme weather situation a shift of resources to protect people and/or organizations is available), application of an existing response in a new context to address the problem (for example, by means of a business continuity system in the conditions of an unexpected extreme). The way of reaction is called coping strategies, where that term refers to the adaptive or constructive mechanisms that are used to reduce stress. Liu et al. (2016) distinguished four dimensions of coping strategies. The first is formalism, which involves ensuring compliance with regulations by setting up internal procedures that adhere strictly to the letter of the law. Accommodation refers to a coping strategy that gives priority to meeting political or bureaucratic demands (Cho et al., 2006), whereas referencing is based on the following guidelines recommended by professional associations. The rest of dimensions—self-determination—emphasizes intellectual flexibility, managerial discretion and autonomy (Kock et al., 2012). Organizations adjust their coping strategies by taking into account the constraints defined by both their internal and external environments.

The ability to react is associated with other dynamic capabilities. This being a dynamic ability in itself, it additionally interacts (and conditions) other abilities. The fact is indicated by Alberts (2011) via comparing the ability to react with:

1. Versatility. This component allows you to achieve acceptable performance/performance levels under new or changed tasks. It is the ability to maintain efficiency as a part of changes in mission and tasks;
2. Flexibility. It creates the ability to perform tasks in more than one way. It allows you to use a different reaction instead of sticking to ineffective previous solutions. Although new solutions may be more costly or time-consuming, the possibility of implementing alternatives is better than none at all. Flexibility can apply to individual components, e.g. equipment, and also to the entire organization;
3. Innovativeness. It concerns situations in which the organization does not see the possibility of a proper reaction. It is then advisable to generate or develop new tactics and methods of conduct, through the use of a novel solution;

(4) Adaptability. It allows an internal change in the organization, procedures and structures to better adapt to challenges.

Coping capacity is absolutely essential for the organization. If it cannot respond in time, then nothing else matters. An organization that can understand the situation sufficiently to make an appropriate choice and increase the coping capacity, prior to the onset of a turbulence, exhibited a sufficient level of responsiveness to allow the potential resilience and flexibility to be realized.

## Resilience of organizations

Many of the recent definitions of organizational resilience embrace the notion of active resilience in a dynamic environment. Traditionally, resilience is viewed as the quality, which enables the individual, community, or organization to cope with, adapt to, and recover from a disaster event (Buckle *et al.*, 2000). Although the term resilience has its roots in science, denoting the ability of materials to return to their original form following deformation (Sheffi, 2006), it is also used to describe the capacity of a system to absorb change, generally conceptualized in the form of sudden shocks, and still retain its essential functionality (Walker *et al.*, 2006). The British Standard 65,000 on Organizational Resilience describes it as an ability of an organization to anticipate, prepare for, and respond and adapt to incremental change and sudden disruptions in order to survive and prosper (BSI, 2014). Conz and Magnani (2020) group papers on resilience into four categories according to their relationship with the temporal phase: (1) resilience as a proactive attribute, before ( $t-1$ ) an event; (2) resilience as absorptive and adaptive attributes, during ( $t$ ) an event; (3) resilience as a reactive attribute, after ( $t+1$ ) an event; (4) resilience as a dynamic attribute, before during and after an event. The first group conceptualizes resilience as a proactive attribute. Resilience is defined as an active response to a crisis situation that involves taking proactive steps to be able to thrive during and after a crisis. It focuses on preparing the organization's resources for the future (Brewton *et al.*, 2010; Danes *et al.*, 2009). A different approach treats resilience as an adaptive attribute in real time. In this approach, resilience is seen as a process rather than an outcome. Scholars who focus on the absorptive aspect of resilience, emphasize the robustness of the firm during the critical event, and the stability of its organizational structure. F.e. Biggs *et al.* (2012) refer to resilience as the capacity of the firm to remain in a stable state during a disturbance, similarly Sin *et al.* (2017). Ismail *et al.* (2011) define resilience as the maintenance of a positive adjustment under challenging conditions and identify "operational agility" as a necessary component to develop resilience. Capacity to withstand and to cope with turbulent changes require special capabilities from organizations. Norris *et al.* (2008) proposed that disaster resilience emerges from a set of four networked capacities (social capital, economic development, community competence, information). Social capital comprises factors, which maintain and sustain social health, including social support, social structures and linkages, community bonds and commitments, and a sense of place. Economic development comprises factors supporting the level of economic resources available to communities, including resource volume, resource diversity and resource equity. Community competence embodies factors, which allow communities to learn and work together flexibly to solve problems, including collective action and decision-making, trust, empowerment and partnerships. Information and communication refer to the creation of common meanings and the opportunities for articulating needs, views and attitudes, including narratives and the infrastructure of public information systems. The interactions between these four dynamic capacities shape the readiness and post-disaster recovery. Compliance with a different approach to the resistance of an organization is treated as a desired state. Lengnick-Hall *et al.* (2011) suggested that the capacity for resilience is developed from a blend of organizational level cognitive, behavioral and contextual capabilities. Specifically, organizational resilience

capacity is composed of (1) cognitive resilience capability, which involves conceptual orientation and constructive sense-making variables, (2) behavioral resilience capability composed of learned resourcefulness, counter-intuitive agility, practical habits and behavioral preparedness variables, and (3) contextual resilience capability, which includes variables for psychological safety, deep social capital, diffused power and accountability, and broad resource networks. Both *Lenngnick-Hall et al.* (2011) and *Giada Scaleria et al.* (2014) introduce the cognitive aspect of resilience without providing further explanation of how cognition-related

mechanisms could support, determine or enhance resilience. The next group of papers related resilience to the post-disaster phase. McPhee (2014) describes resilience as the capacity to survive disruptions, while Pal, Westerlund and Torstensson (2013) and Smallbone et al. (2012) view resilience as the ability of firms to respond to times of crisis, or to a change and to maintain their competitive advantage. These studies treat resilience as an ability to recover to a previous equilibrium state. They emphasize the adaptive aspects of being resilient, the dynamic absorption of a shock. Resilience has also been defined as a magnitude. Under this view, resilience is the level of disturbance an organization can tolerate and still survive (Linnenluecke and Griffiths, 2010; Limnios et al., 2014). These papers refer to the theory of ecological adaptation, where resilience implies a dynamic adaptation by recombining existing resources to emerge strengthened and more resourceful. Limnios et al. (2014) indicate that the above approaches are different manifestations of resilience as either offense (adaptation) or defense (resistance) to internal or external disturbance. Resilience assumes a primarily offensive, anticipative character when the system operates at a desirable system state. On the other side, resilience assumes a primarily defensive character (resistance to change) when the system operates at an undesirable system state. A similar dichotomy is indicated by Rahi (2019), who divides indicators aiming to measure organizational resilience in two dimensions, relating to being proactive and manage possible disruptive events and the organization's capacity to transform its structure, processes, culture, etc.

While defining resilience is clearly challenging, identifying the features of organizations, which make them resilient is even more difficult. Although researchers differ in the terms that they use to describe features of organizational resilience they nevertheless, orient their analyses around such features as redundancy, resourcefulness, effective communication and self-organization (Kendra and Wachtendorf, 2003). One of the most important conceptualizations of organizational resilience stems from Weick (1993). He identified four potential sources of resilience, which allow for effective responses in the case of unexpected events: bricolage, virtual role systems, wisdom, and respectful interaction. Bricolage is the capacity to improvise and apply creativity in problem-solving. It refers to the practice of creating order out of whatever is available. A virtual role system enables the members of an organization to simultaneously develop a shared vision of emergent challenges and ranges of action (Kendra and Wachtendorf, 2003). Wisdom is defined as the capacity to question what is known, to appreciate the limits of knowledge and to seek new information. Finally, respectful interaction consists of respecting the reports of others and being willing to act on them; reporting honestly to others; and respecting one's own perceptions and trying to integrate them with others (Kendra and Wachtendorf, 2003). Weick (1993) argues that these four principles facilitate collective sense-making, and thus, can help to avoid the dramatic consequences of unexpected events. In turn, McManus identified resilience in an organizational context as a function of an organization's situation awareness, management of keystone vulnerabilities, and adaptive capacity in a complex, dynamic and interconnected environment. Other attributes or elements of a resilient organization include building situation awareness (Braes and Brooks, 2011), managing organization's vulnerabilities (Erol et al., 2010), having resources (Aleksic et al., 2013), improvisation capacity (Coutu, 2002), ability to anticipate events (Apneseth et al., 2013). An overview of resistance-related features is presented by Ruiz-Martin et al. (2018).

## Flexibility

Holweg (2005) defines flexibility as a generic ability to adapt to internal and/or external influences. Dla Escrig-Tena *et al.* (2011) flexibility means a firm's abilities to respond to problems speedily, rethink its activities and strategies, and better meet environmental demands. Vokurka and Fliedner (1998) conceptualize flexibility as the capability of an organization to move from one task to another quickly and as a routine procedure. It means that flexibility is an enabling ability to change status within the current configuration (a pre-established and limited scope and achievability). The scope is the number of different states that can be achieved. The achievability is the transition cost and time to move from one state to another within the established scope.

While considering the essence of flexibility, one might apply (De Toni and Tonchia, 2005):

1. The economic approach,
2. The organizational approach.

As far as the economic approach is concerned, the notion of flexibility was presented in the economic literature for the first time by G. Stigler (Carlsson, 1989). He defined flexibility as the property of manufacturing, which allows for applying various variants of production. He suggested that the company is more flexible with regard to its production volume if it has a lower final cost, connected with changes in the production volume. Thus, he made flexibility dependent on the form of a curve of production costs, assuming that the flatter the curve of (unit) costs with a slower increase of the final cost, the greater the flexibility. G. Stigler also investigated flexibility understood as a company's response to uncertainty connected with the demand fluctuation. With time, the notion of flexibility was broadened, taking into consideration all types of turbulences in the firm's environment, not only changes in demand. Flexibility in management sciences is not an end in itself, but a means that enables a desirable outcome (Bernardes and Hanna, 2009). This permits the organization to try another response instead of having to adhere to an ineffective, preempted one. Through flexibility, organizations may anticipate changes in their environment, mount an offensive and try to control changes in their environment. Alternatively, they may react to the changes once they reveal their impact. Such an understanding of flexibility indicates its reactive or proactive dimension. In reactive understanding, this term is posited as the ability to allow for a key response to environmental changes, particularly when faced with fierce competition (Fernandez-Perez *et al.*, 2012). Proactive flexibility is related to model, shape and transforms firms' environment (Perez-Valls *et al.*, 2015; Combe *et al.*, 2012; Sushil, 2015). Volberda (1998) states that organizational flexibility derives from the control capacity of the management and the controllability of the organization. From this definition, organizational flexibility is treated as a two-dimensional concept: the managerial task and the organizational design task. Both tasks need to match the combination of environmental characteristics.

Taking into account strategies for using flexibility, Gerwin (1993) distinguishes adaptive and redefinition strategies. The adaptive strategy refers to the defensive or reactive use of flexible competencies to accommodate unknown uncertainty, while the redefinition strategy refers to the proactive use of flexible competencies to raise customer expectations, increase uncertainty for rivals and gain a competitive edge.

With regard to the outcomes, the review shows that most of the previous literature in the field consider the positive relationships between flexibility and superior performance (Combe *et al.*, 2012; Nadkarni and Narayanan, 2007; Saini and Johnson, 2005), and between flexibility and competitive advantage (Zhang, 2005; Nandakumar *et al.*, 2014). Some authors have concluded that flexibility increase perceived service quality (Gylling *et al.*, 2012), increased innovation capabilities (Fan *et al.*, 2013), contribute to new product development (Kandemir and Acur, 2012). These benefits are achieved by the process of performing flexibility,

referring to other managerial practices and strategies (see f.e. Escrig-Tena *et al.*, 2011). The analytical model implies relationships between different aspects of flexibility, and the existence of various combinations of relationships between triggers, dimensions, enablers, barriers, processes and outcomes is presented in Brozovic (2018).

Organizations' coping capacity and resilience

### Flexibility, resilience, coping capacity – an attempt to determine the interdependence

Flexibility, resilience and coping capacity are common, related concepts in a number of scientific disciplines, and they have gained currency in disaster work. A key question that emerges, however, concerns the relationship between them. Is resilience the opposite of coping capacity? Is flexibility a factor of coping capacity? and so on.

The dependencies between coping capacity and resilience presented in the literature have different characters. Although there are several conceptualizations of the relationship between resilience and coping capacity (for example, Cutter *et al.*, 2008), a general consensus that they are closely related exists at present (Brown and Westaway, 2011; Maclean *et al.*, 2014). The resilience approach helps us understand the relationship between coping capacity and adaptation: measures and actions undertaken now will determine whether an organization has the ability to reorganize or whether it will collapse in the future (Abel *et al.*, 2006). Hence, coping capacity can be treated as a component of resilience (Paton, 2007). Linnenluecke and Griffiths (2010) explain that capabilities enabling organizations to prepare for extreme weather events (e.g. anticipatory adaptation, robustness) were thought to be key elements of resilience (Dalziell and McManus, 2004). McEntire (2001) determines coping capacity as being a function of in-built resistance and resilience. Organizations must possess coping capabilities to realize their resilience potential. For example, they must be able to apply their crisis plans and use their collective knowledge to develop crisis specific solutions (Duchek, 2020).

According to a different approach, resistance is one of the dimensions of the reaction capability. Pelling (2003) views resilience as a component of the ability of an actor to cope with or adapt to hazard stress. That includes the planned preparation and the spontaneous or premeditated adjustments undertaken in the face of natural hazards. Adger (2006) takes a similar position.

Others (UN International Strategy, 2002) interpret resilience as the “flip”—positive—side of vulnerability or the ability to resist damage. Resilience is treated as the capacity of an organization to absorb and recover from the occurrence of a hazardous event. Both abilities reflect an increased recognition of people's ability to face climate-related and other natural hazards, which was not captured in the mainly negative concept of vulnerability. They refer to resources and assets people possess to resist, cope with and recover from disaster shocks they experience (Davis, 1984).

Holweg (2005) presents one of the seminal attempts at differentiating coping capacity and flexibility. He identifies three determinant factors of responsiveness, which he calls “dimensions of responsiveness.” By referring to resilience, some authors highlight that it is supported by flexibility. Resilience implies uncertainty about the future state (configuration) of the organization. Various types or forms of flexibility refer to specific internal mechanisms, which may be employed to contribute to the overall organizational coping capacity. As a consequence, flexibility often represents the means of responding to changes. Flexibility is an attribute of the system, while responsiveness is an outcome or use of that capability to address stimuli. This illustrates the notion that flexibility indicates the capability of the operating system to absorb disturbances, while responsiveness indicates how well the system behaves vis-à-vis market change. Daugherty and Pittman (1995) suggest that responsiveness is a performance-related concept originating from the interaction with

markets, while flexibility is an internal capability that may or may not interface with the external environment. Muller, Koslowski and Accorsi (2013) link the concept of resilience with flexibility by indicating that resilience is a system's ability to bounce back from disruptions and disasters by building in redundancy and flexibility. Rice and Caniato (2003) focus on security and resilience by upholding flexibility and redundancy as two methods with the greatest potential to create resilience. Sheffi (2005) employs flexibility as a means to achieve resilience, stating that “instead of relying solely on supply chain redundancy, a well-managed firm should develop resilience, by building flexibility that can be used to “bounce back” from disruptions.” Flexibility or agility, robustness and resilience are different sides of the same coin (Asbjørnslett, 2008). Flexibility, or agility, denotes the inherent capability to modify a current direction to accommodate and successfully adapt to changes in the environment, whereas coping capacity refers to the ability to endure such changes without adapting. Differences between the examined terms are summarized in Table 1.

### From single components to scientific theories

According to the resource-based theory (RBV), organizations that own strategic resources have important competitive advantages over organizations that do not. Resources are strategic to the extent that they are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and non-substitutable (Barney, 1991). Capabilities are one of the key concepts within the resource-based theory. Capabilities tend to arise over time as a firm takes actions, which build on its strategic resources. Building on RBV, dynamic capabilities (DC) mean that an organization has a unique capability of creating new capabilities. In other words, an organization that enjoys a dynamic capability is skilled at continually updating its array of capabilities to keep pace with changes in its environment. Zollo and Winter (2002) defined dynamic capabilities as learned and stable patterns of collective activity, enabling an organization to improve effectiveness through generating and modifying their operating routines. Based on the definition of Teece *et al.* (1997), and the research of Eisenhardt and Martin (2000), dynamic capabilities allow to integrate, reconfigure, gain and release resources in order to match and even create changes. Both resilience, as well as coping capacity and flexibility, belong to dynamic capabilities. This research is based on dynamic capability as a theoretical

background. Coping capacity refers to an organization's ability to rapidly respond to changes in an uncertain business environment, and its capability to survive and prosper through quick and effective reactions. Upton (1995) refers to flexibility as the ability to adapt or change at the plant level, whereas Zhang *et al.* (2003) suggest that this ability exhibits the attributes of robustness (maintaining the status quo despite change) versus agility (instigating change rather than reacting to it). Resilience constitutes the capacity to effectively absorb, respond to and potentially capitalize on disruptive surprises. Resilience and coping capacity are complementary capabilities. They both offer the potential for enhancing the organization's capability set as a direct consequence of the response activities. In order to reflect the time in the dynamic nature of dynamic capabilities theory, this research investigates the moderating effects of the dynamics of environment on the relationship between the studied dynamic capabilities.

## Toward a conceptual framework

All three capabilities share common roots. As we proved, they belong to the so-called dynamic capabilities. Thus, a range of skills, resources and competences that contribute to resilience simultaneously help develop a company's coping capacity and flexibility. Coping capacity is rooted in resources, being endogenous to the organization, which is the traditional knowledge, indigenous skills and technologies. Similarly, resistance is based on internal resources. Its level depends on structural solutions, but also on the level of knowledge, learning abilities, etc. Similarly, a number of competencies that positively influence the organization's resilience also positively affect its flexibility, e.g. double-loop learning, open communication, promoting internal collaboration and process integration. A number of authors draw attention to close relationships between the surveyed capabilities, indicating the broader significance of resistance (Bernardes and Hanna, 2009). It covers the flexibility and coping capacity as its integral components. Therefore

*H1.* Skills and competencies, which contribute to resilience, also contribute to coping capacity and flexibility. Therefore, as an organization works to develop its resilience, it concurrently creates a foundation for coping capacity and flexibility.

Coping capacity and flexibility are the essential capabilities that characterize the adaptive path of a firm when facing shocks. Coping capacity (adaptability) is the capability to adjust the firm's response and to adapt internal processes to changing external conditions (Folke *et al.*, 2002). Flexibility is the capability of implementing rapid decision-making processes, quick internal communication and fast learning so as to quickly adapt routines and strategies to changing conditions (Pal *et al.*, 2014). Coping capacity strengthens the ability to absorb turbulences while flexibility determines adaptability. Conz and Magnani (2020) explain that the resilience of an organization is characterized by two dynamic paths: the absorptive and the adaptive that are both equally effective for the achievement of a positive adjustment after a shock. Hence coping capacity and flexibility constitute core capabilities for organizational resilience.

Direct and indirect connections between these constructs suggest that strong resilience creates a useful internal guidance system for organizational analysis and decision making, enabling the diagnosis of the environmental conditions and select the most effective behaviors more accurately. Consequently, as organization builds its resilience capacity it simultaneously enhances a foundation for creating coping capacity and flexibility.

*H2.* Organizations with high levels of resilience are more likely to have a high level of coping capacity and flexibility.

Sutcliffe and Vogus (2003) suggested that organizational resilience provides firms with capabilities to mediate the unexpected and encourage growth by assessing their processes,

structures, and practices by promoting competence, flexibility, malleability, convertible, and restorative efficacy. They treat resilience as the ability and speed of return to normal performance levels following disruptions, through reducing vulnerability, and building redundancy and flexibility. In this sense, flexibility supports the resilience of the organization; it is a prerequisite for becoming resilient. Coping capacity is the ability of an organization to make rapid and balanced adjustments to the predictable and unpredictable changes. It is a buffer that absorbs small turbulence. Koornhof (2001) points out that this capability enables survival in the face of unprecedented threats from the business environment, and thus, determines the possibility of further reacting and functioning. In the context of resilience, flexibility and coping capacity allow organizations to absorb uncertainty by functioning as a buffer for them. These capacities strengthen each other's impact and effectiveness. The impact of individual capabilities, e.g. flexibility on resilience, is smaller than the total flexibility and coping capacity. Our view is consistent with Corning (1995) conception of synergy. The synergy results from combined effects and interactions between capabilities.

### *H3. Flexibility and coping capacity have a synergistic effect on resilience.*

Detracting capabilities would be more frequently present in less resilient firms. Those capabilities which are necessary but not sufficient would be expected to be present in all firms, and they may also be present in organizations resilient through to middling firms.

Figure 3 depicts how different levels of coping capacity and flexibility may be present in organizations of various resilience levels.

Coping capacity and flexibility are not in themselves sufficient to shape a resilient organization. Collins (2015) points out that resilience requires additional capabilities: processes to direct internal R&D, delineating the customer solution and business model, selecting enterprise boundaries to manage complements and control platforms, avoiding decision errors and anticannibalization proclivities, decentralization, governance, and knowledge management capabilities. Parsons *et al.* (2006) distinguish two sets of capacities: coping capacities and adaptive capacities. Therefore, resilience is created by the application of bundles of dynamic capabilities.

### *H4. Coping capacity and flexibility are necessary but not sufficient to create resilience.*

From the resource-based theory perspective, firms are viewed as a unique bundle of resources and capabilities, which enables them to develop competitive advantages. Organizations need

resources to take advantage of their capabilities. However, having resources alone does not guarantee a competitive advantage. Only the use of resources differentiates organizations. The application of dynamic capabilities activates leveraging other resources (Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003); enhances learning (Zollo and Winter, 2002; Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003); flexibility (Zahra et al., 2006); responsiveness in turbulent environments (Zahra and George, 2002). As a consequence, dynamic capabilities do not in themselves create efficiency. Instead, they help to create operational capabilities, which are efficient (Teece, 2007).

Resilience is a process that leads to “superior outcomes,” a form of “spontaneous prevention of risk occurring without external intervention” (Brodsky et al., 2011). McCann et al. (2009) demonstrate that agility and anti-resilience have significant positive correlations with both performance measures: profitability and competitiveness. Their results indicate that firms can build competitiveness, even in turbulent conditions, by being more agile and resilient.

Coping capacity is a different, important capability needed for firms to achieve a competitive advantage (Matson and McFarlane, 1999; Holweg, 2005; Storey et al., 2005; Reichhart and Holweg, 2007). Bessant et al. (2003) assert that competitive success in manufacturing is strongly linked to the ability of a firm to respond quickly and flexibly to its environment and meet the emerging challenges with innovative responses; they call such abilities responsiveness.

Flexibility also has a positive impact on financial results. Organizations characterized by high levels of both internal and external flexibilities (instead of that have high levels of both internal and external flexibilities) were found to have a second level of performance (Dias and Escoval, 2014). Yuan et al. (2010) found that coordination flexibility (i.e. effectively and efficiently integrating and deploying organizational resources) positively moderated the relationship between product innovation and firm performance (i.e. market position, sales volume, profit rate, reputation) in highly competitive environments. Moreover, Verdu-Jover et al. (2004) examined the match between a firm's flexibility and environmental requirements on operational (e.g. variation in the volume of production), structural (e.g. job enrichment), strategic level (e.g. speed of strategic change). Their findings revealed a significant and positive relationship between operational flexibility and business performance (i.e. sales growth, ROA, ROS, overall performance, growth success).

H5. Both flexibilities, coping capacity and resistance contribute to super firm performance in turbulent conditions.

According to contingency theory, which helps us to understand the interrelationships between the alignment of organizational capabilities, and performance in relation to environmental conditions, firm performance is dependent on the match between the external context and internal arrangements. Contingency theory comprises of contextual (or contingency), response (i.e. organizational or managerial actions in response to contingency factors), and performance variables (Sousa and Voss, 2008). In light of such assumptions, the external turbulence can be

Skills, competencies, Coping capacity, and Flexibility all influence Resilience (H1, H3, H4, H5). Resilience influences Firm performance in turbulent conditions (H2, H4, H5). Firm performance in turbulent conditions also influences Coping capacity (H5).](8b79f5ec940d107c246612c2a2ec519f_img.jpg)

regarded as a contingency factor moderating the capabilities-performance relationships. The same proposition 5 is consistent with the contingency theory.

## Conclusions

This work responds to the recent call for research along these lines in Duchek (2020) by attempting to address the wide conceptual ambiguity associated with the terms, flexibility, coping capacity and organizational resilience. This study first carries out an analysis of the terms—types, elements, dimensions, parameters and others. Then, it identifies the existing similarities and differences among them. In this way, the paper would contribute to the conceptual systematization of the flexibility, coping capacity, resilience constructs by synthesizing the vast literature available in an attempt to address the conceptual ambiguity associated with them. This conceptual systematization and attempt to determine the relationships between these constructs are a necessary preliminary step in the development of the field, which will permit future researchers to advance in the homogeneous operationalization of the terms.

The differentiation of terms proposed in this study has important theoretical and practical implications. Establishing clear definitions is a necessary first step for research progress in any field. This study has proposed a conceptual differentiation of the terms flexibility, coping capacity, and resilience. By referring to resilience, our research has shown that this capability plays a superior role in relation to other capabilities, and thus, has an implication for the modus operandi of disaster/ crisis management. In opposition to previous papers, which treated resilience on an equal with other dynamic capabilities, our results indicate that resilience can be conceptualized as a meta-capability consisting of a set of organizational capabilities. Coping capacity refers to the effective handling of unexpected events, and its ability to absorb disturbances, assimilate deviations. The ability to adapt to changes is conditioned by the flexibility of the organization. In addition, resilience can substantially contribute to a firm's ability to both develop a long-term resistance to shocks and in the selection of the most appropriate form of reaction in turbulent conditions. Therefore, resilience can be viewed as a moderator of the relationship between coping capacity and flexibility and subsequent firm performance.

One important contribution of this study is a better understanding of the relationships between flexibility, coping capacity, and resilience, which enable an organization to thrive under different conditions. Together, requisite capabilities give an organization the best chance of successfully coping with a turbulence. Flexibility and coping capacity contribution to resilience constitutes a new source of power and lies in the nature of relationships emerging among organizations. Second, resilience enhances organizations' ability to select the most appropriate form of coping capacity at a particular point in time. It also supports organizations' efforts to implement, reconfigure, integrate, or release resources toward the desired configuration. It provides increased access to important resources by fostering and building on strong network relationships. Resilience is possible through resourcefulness, adaptability and flexibility. A better understanding of the connections among resilience, flexibility, coping capacity and organizational performance contributes to the growing literature on dynamic capabilities.

Our paper offers certain managerial implications as well. Resilience capacity can be developed and managed. This implies that managers should build the capacities to effectively analyze and shape resilience. These can constitute activities directed at reinforcing resilience or related to shaping flexibility and coping capacity. Through such activities, managers can actively attend to their firm's resilience levels in order to achieve greater potential outcomes.

Our model, being emergent, stemming inductively from existing literature, has some limitations. The main concerns that the model does not account for the heterogeneity of

potential environmental conditions that might be a threat or alter the equilibrium of organization, rather it more generally refers to all shocks/risks. Empirical research is needed to investigate the relationships among the different types of events and different responses.

A better understanding of studied relationships offers a number of interesting research directions. For example, while a variety of resources and competencies are likely to underpin all capabilities, it would be useful to examine the specific resources that are universally useful in generating capabilities and the resources and competencies that are more strongly associated with resilience. Future research can build on our study via efforts to empirically test the propositions. Verification of the proposed hypotheses will contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between resilience, coping capacity, and flexibility. In addition, future process studies might investigate how organizations actually prepare for unexpected events, accept problems, and learn from them. Finally, because improving certain capabilities can amplify other capabilities, we hope that our study will stimulate further research, which can empirically advance understanding of how resilience is achieved. It is about answering the question regarding which mechanisms, such as flexibility or coping capacity, stimulate the development of resilience.
