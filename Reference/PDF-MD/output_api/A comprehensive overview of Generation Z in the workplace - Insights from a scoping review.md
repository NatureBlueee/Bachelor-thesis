## Introduction

The current generation called Generation Z (Gen Z) is entering the workforce. According to IDN Research Institute (2023), nearly half of Gen Z has reached working-age and is currently employed. This demographic significance is substantial, comprising more than a quarter of the United States (US) population (Deloitte, 2022), while in Indonesia, data from Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) show that Gen Z is currently the largest generation, followed by millennials (BPS, 2020; Kompas.com, 2021). Gen Z refers to individuals born roughly between 1995 and 2010 (Bencik et al., 2016; Wijoyo et al., 2020), but some definitions extend this range to 2012, as described in the Generation Grouping by William H. Frey – Analysis of Census Bureau Population Estimates (BFS, 2020). This generation is distinguished by unique experiences and characteristics shaped by rapid technological advancements and impactful global events. Gen Z is often described as 'digital natives' because of extensive engagement with technology and is entering the workforce during a period of significant transformation (Deloitte Insights, 2017). The importance of understanding Gen Z workplace dynamics has become increasingly critical, particularly as millennials are expected to largely retire by 2050. Research by Xueyun et al. (2023) predicted that Gen Z, currently aged 18–28 years, would surpass millennials in numbers by 2050. Furthermore, Johns Hopkins University (2023) predicts that by 2030, this generation will constitute 30% of the workforce. This prediction shows the need to better understand Gen Z, as they will play a larger role in the workforce in the coming years. The entry of Gen Z into the workplace presents a significant challenge, particularly regarding their expectations. Gen Z tends to prioritise work-life balance, with an environment that supports

personal well-being alongside professional growth. This is different from earlier generations, who may have placed a higher value on job security or conventional benefits (Lazányi & Bilan, 2017; Raslie & Ting, 2021). As a result, organisations need to adjust their human resource policies to accommodate these new demands.

Gen Z possesses exceptional characteristics different from previous generations (Bulut, 2021; Wijoyo et al., 2020), but shares some features with millennials. Bencsik et al. (2016) described Gen Z as having a non-committal mindset, content with their current circumstances, and focused on living in the present. In addition, the primary objective of the generation in life is to accept the moment, with technology playing a central role in their lives, further reinforcing the focus on the present. This view supports the findings by Weiss and Zhang (2020), stating that participants across different countries consistently evaluated older generations more positively than younger ones. Older generations often describe Gen Z as careless, impolite, and lazy, with an accusation of using mental health concerns as an excuse to avoid responsibility (IDN Research Institute, 2023).

According to research by Beugelsdijk and Welzel (2018), younger generations, including Gen Z are now happier and more individualistic. Furthermore, technological advancements are shaping the communication practices of Gen Z in the workplace (Raslie & Ting, 2021). Gen Z is quick to respond to issues, has fast access to information, and actively finds out content. The main difference between Gen Z and previous generations lies in the relationship with technology and the values being prioritised (Holton & Fraser, 2015; Wijoyo et al., 2020). The IDN Research Institute (2023) reported that, besides salary, opportunities for career growth and a positive work environment were the main reasons Gen Z would decide to stay with organisations. The research also found that side hustles have become increasingly common among Gen Z because of rising financial pressure. In addition, many working-age individuals possess more work experience and have developed broader professional networks, leading to feeling more entitled to pursue side jobs or freelance work. The height of confidence, individual skills, and improved understanding of market value empower Gen Z to take on additional work responsibilities.

Gen Z appreciates the ability to make personal decisions and work independently in the workplace, and also desires a sense of purpose and a positive social influence from individual employment. Xueyun et al. (2023) found that emotional commitment was crucial for Gen Z to feel comfortable in organisations. According to Nozaki and Kobayashi (2024), instrumental motives, such as emotions, play a significant role in improving performance.

The workplace attributes appreciated by Gen Z surpass personal preferences, necessitating that organisations adopt this value. The adaptation should consider distinct work attitudes and expectations (Schroth, 2019), particularly in a constantly changing workforce. To effectively accommodate Gen Z, organisations need to address intergenerational issues and integrate workplace rules with work habits as well as beliefs

(Gomes et al., 2023). In addition, organisations are required to recognise specific demands and values of this age group, as Gen Z is incorporated into the workplace. Research shows that internal factors such as enthusiasm and a sense of accomplishment are strong motivators, signifying the importance of meeting job-related elements for effective engagement (Jung & Yoon, 2021). According to Minkov et al. (2024), varying principles and aims across cultures can hinder the progress of cross-cultural research, and this age group possesses unique cultural traditions. It is crucial to examine these differences as a foundation for future research. Zehetner et al. (2022) found significant differences in leadership style preferences among the representatives of Gen Z from diverse cultural backgrounds. Moreover, organisations need to provide a supportive environment with transparent procedures and clear rewards to improve workplace motivation and development for employees (Mahmoud et al., 2021).

Previous workplace research often focused on different generations, but there had been limited exploration specifically concerning Gen Z (Fan et al., 2023). Moreover, Gen Z plays a significant role in various industries and is recognised for its proficiency with digital technology. The digital fluency of Gen Z offers organisations both opportunities and challenges. The first generation to grow up entirely in the digital era has become quite skilled at utilising technology for communication and collaboration (Lazányi & Bilan, 2017; Raslie & Ting, 2021). Lazar et al. (2023) conducted a literature review that emphasises the importance of diversity and inclusion in attracting Gen Z employees, with a focus on the role of technology in shaping their workplace preferences. Although these findings are valuable, they do not provide a holistic view of how organisations can implement changes across various departments to accommodate the integration of Gen Z into the workforce.

As the largest demographic set, Gen Z is increasingly influential across different sectors of the workplace. Organisations are becoming more aware of the importance of associating their work principles with workplace policies and procedures (Gomes et al., 2023). Research by Doery et al. (2023) showed that local culture influenced intergenerational relationships. While Bencsik et al. (2016) emphasised the unique nature of Gen Z and the need for preparation from leaders and human resources (HR) professionals, they did not provide specific strategies to address potential conflicts arising from generational differences in communication and work styles (Bencsik et al., 2016). This lack of comprehensive strategies can leave organisations unprepared to manage the complexities of a multigenerational workforce. Although existing research offers valuable insights into the specific traits and behaviours of Gen Z, a comprehensive framework addressing the broader implications for workplace integration is limited. Therefore, organisations aiming to adapt to the generational shift require more evidence-based guidance that synthesises these results into actionable strategies to create an inclusive and effective work environment.

The current literature remains fragmented and lacks a comprehensive synthesis of the results, despite the growing interest in exploring the impact of Gen Z on the workplace. Previous research focused on specific aspects of Gen Z work preferences or behaviours, leading to a fragmented understanding of their expectations and contributions (Fan et al., 2023; Sigaeva et al., 2022). This gap described the need for more comprehensive research that addresses the various dimensions of Gen Z experiences in the workplace, including their motivation, challenges, and implications for organisational practices. As Gen Z continues to shape and influence the workforce, this progressive development becomes increasingly relevant (Pandita & Khatwani, 2022). This review comprised previous research that highlights key themes related to Gen Z in the workplace. In addition, it aims to analyse these results to provide a thorough understanding of Gen Z role and characteristics in the workplace. The objective is to provide an overview of Gen Z based on existing literature. To effectively manage personnel within organisations, particularly those belonging to Gen Z, it is essential to understand their distinct characteristics and expectations. The central research question guiding the review is, 'What are the key findings from previous research about Gen Z in the workplace?'

## Materials and methodsScoping review framework

A scoping review methodology was used in this study to provide a comprehensive overview of Gen Z in the workplace. This scoping review is a literature review method designed to describe the key concepts in a research area, along with the sources and types of evidence available. Although scoping reviews did not assess the quality of research, they offered valuable insights into specific areas and served as a preliminary step towards a more comprehensive systematic review (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005). This methodology offered more enhanced flexibility in developing specific research questions and assisted in comprehending the context and extent of existing evidence before conducting more detailed analyses (Munn et al., 2018). Given the evolving and fragmented nature of research on Gen Z in the workplace, a scoping review was the most appropriate method to provide a thorough overview and identify key themes without being restricted by overly restrictive research questions.

This research followed the guidelines outlined by PRISMA 2020 guidelines, as suggested by Page et al. (2021), shown in Figure 1. It represented a significant advancement from the original PRISMA 2009 guidelines, extending the application to scoping reviews and ensuring transparency and rigour in the reporting process. PRISMA 2020 was designed for both systematic reviews and also for scoping reviews, as stated by Page et al. (2021). This ensured that the methodological approach was consistent with the review. The theoretical foundation for scoping reviews, as initially proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), informed the methodological steps in this study. These steps included (1) identifying the relevant question, (2) identifying relevant research,

(3) selecting, (4) charting the data, as well as (5) collating, summarising, and reporting the results. By integrating the foundational principles with the updated reporting standards of PRISMA, this research was consistent with the most recent advancements in scoping review practices.

### Identifying the research question

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of Gen Z in the workplace based on existing literature. The central question guiding the review was, 'What are the key findings from previous research about Gen Z in the workplace?'. To guide the literature search and ensure consistency with the research question, this current research used PCC (Population, Concept, Context) framework. This review focused on employees who were part of Gen Z (population), explored the concept in workplace settings (concept), and examined the workplace as the context. PCC framework was combined with Boolean operators and systematic keyword searches customised to each database. Consistency and relevance were ensured by iteratively refining search terms based on the initial results.

### Identifying relevant research

This research identified the relevant literature concerning the investigation in a literature review. During the investigation, the first step was to establish a database. The research then determined the keywords that were included in the electronic database search. The keywords used were (Gen\* Z, OR Z gen\*) and (workplace, organisation, or company). Other words included ('Gen\* Z' worker', 'Gen\* Z' employee\*, 'Z Gen\* worker' OR 'Z Gen\* employee\*'). Following the discussion, the search was performed around November 2023, according to the keywords as well as the database that had been determined, and then saved in the reference manager (RM). The research used five (5) databases, namely Web of Science (WoS),

This leads to 'Records removed before screening: Duplicate records removed (n=25)'. The remaining records are 'Records screened (n=115)'. This leads to 'Records excluded (n=64)'. The remaining records are 'Article screened by title and abstract (n=51)'. This leads to 'Reports not retrieved (n=14)'. The remaining records are 'Reports assessed for eligibility (n=37)'. This leads to 'Reports excluded: Not meeting the criteria (n=26)'. The remaining records are 'Research included in review (n=11)'. The final step is 'Included'.](2b37b4c11c25b2f26358c3d686ed3441_img.jpg)

EBSCOhost, Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest. The search process during the investigation is shown in Table 1.

### Research selection

Selection was conducted in three steps including, (1) detecting articles that were shown as duplicates, (2) initial selection based on title and abstract, and (3) selection based on complete article availability. Based on the results of relevant research, all articles obtained from the results were inputted into RM. Following this discussion, Rayyan.ai (a web-based software) was used to support systematic reviews and scoping processes by expediting the screening of papers imported in Research Information System (RIS) format. The program supported the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria methodically, focusing on Gen Z and the workplace. This methodology ensured the consistent and unbiased selection of relevant research for further analysis. Initially, 115 articles were imported into Rayyan.ai, and inclusion criteria were applied, leading to the selection of 11 literature that addressed the core topic of this research. The software optimised the article screening process by enabling filtering based on metadata, abstracts, keywords, publication year, and relevance to the research question. The benefits of using Rayyan.ai included minimising bias in the screening process and ensuring that all important articles were considered. Moreover, articles that were marked as duplicates were identified, reducing the initial total of 140 articles to 115 for import into rayyan.ai in RIS format. This step is essential to ensure no article is counted more than once, maintaining the accuracy of our dataset. Before proceeding to selection, the research first determined the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as shown in Table 2. After completing the search phase, the investigation identified and used 11 articles that met the inclusion criteria.

### Charting data

Charting data represented a critical step in a scoping review process, aimed at systematically extracting essential information from each article. This step included gathering key elements such as the author's name, article title, year of publication, research objectives, methodology, key findings, and evolving themes (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005). The objective was to summarise the main results of each research, which would then facilitate further data analysis and interpretation (Page et al., 2021). By organising the data in a structured manner, the research integrated the results more effectively, enabling a thorough analysis of trends associated with Gen Z in the workplace. Therefore, charting data allowed for the systematic organisations and analysis of information from different research, providing a clearer understanding of the landscape in this field.

### Collating, summarising and reporting the results

Recurring themes and patterns were identified through an iterative review of the extracted data. The analysis was conducted with a focus on the research question, examining key aspects such as Gen Z workplace expectations, the role of

technology in their productivity, intergenerational challenges, and the significance of leadership style for Gen Z employees.

### Ethical considerations

This study is a literature review, and as such, no human participants or primary data were involved. All sources used in the review were properly cited and referenced according to ethical guidelines for academic integrity. All secondary data was sourced and acknowledged in accordance with intellectual property rights.

## Results

### Research distribution data

As explained in Figure 1, 11 articles that met the criteria were selected. A total of 11 articles were from 5 databases, namely WoS, EBSCOhost, Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest. In terms of the year of publication, the earliest article was published in 2017, and the latest in 2023. All these results were research articles that focused on Gen Z employees in the workplace. Moreover, the respondent population who participated in the research came from various countries, including China (2), Russia (1), India (3), Romania (1), Malaysia (1), Saudi Arabia (1), Hungary (1), and Austria + Ukraine (1). The methodology used was quantitative research with a total of 4465 participants. A review of the examined articles for this research is shown in Table 3. The themes identified in this review, including Gen Z work expectations, the role of technology, intergenerational challenges, and the significance of leadership style, had significant implications for Gen Z intention to stay with or leave organisations. These themes identified the factors influencing the intention to stay or leave organisations, as detailed in the subsequent discussion section.

## Discussion

The themes identified were consistent with the objectives of scoping reviews, which aimed to provide an overview or a comprehensive understanding of Gen Z in the workplace based on existing research, rather than synthesising data to answer specific questions.

### Gen Z work expectations

Businesses are currently addressing management challenges associated with Gen Z employees. The distinctive characteristics of this age group necessitated urgent updates to organisational management practices (Fan et al., 2023). In addition, employees in professional environments often face tasks that did not relate to their personal responsibilities and realistic expectations. These tasks included meeting personal obligations or attending to the requests of a leader (Fan et al., 2023). As the presence of Gen Z employees in the workforce continue to grow, organisations needed to recognise and accommodate distinct attitudes and habits. This implied that organisational success could be achieved by minimising drawbacks and ensuring the progress of the next generation.

This research signified that Gen Z employees showed different behaviours in the workplace compared to employees from earlier generations. Consequently, establishing strong interpersonal relationships was essential for adapting to the distinct work style of this age group (Lazányi & Bilan, 2017). The current employees showed varying levels of trust towards their coworkers and leaders compared to previous generations, as the age group did not typically hold leaders in high esteem. Therefore, managers and colleagues should actively work to earn the respect and trust of their subordinates by showing individual professional brilliance.

The modern workforce is composed of multiple generations collaborating within a single workplace. As the number of Gen Z employees increased, the task became more difficult because these organisations had different traits, attitudes, and expectations, which formed new challenges (Sigaeva et al., 2022). Companies exhibited different traits and attitudes because of unique cultures, which shaped employee behaviour and values. Leadership styles also played a crucial role, as

Transformational leaders inspired innovation, while authoritarian leaders created a more rigid environment. Furthermore, organisational characteristics influenced traits, with tech firms prioritising agility and manufacturing firms focusing on efficiency. The demographics of the workforce, including factors such as age and cultural background, significantly influenced their attitudes towards work and expectations for career advancement. Lastly, geographical location and cultural norms shaped an organisation's method of teamwork and individual achievement. This investigation explained how understanding motivations and meeting the needs of Gen Z might require extra effort, but it mainly required a shift in perspective. This method could improve the generation performance at work and, eventually, contribute to corporate success. Firstly, staff members felt that organisations valued and supported the staff, leading to increased participation in organisations activities when the members experienced a sense of being valued and cared for. Secondly, managers should show that the well-being and opinions of employees are very important. Lastly, because employees were team players, the business should improve a culture where team members collaborate and have faith in one another. As a result of an extensive analysis of current and impending strategies, the results would assist firms and legislators in progressing as well as improving policies to better engage Gen Z employees who are joining the workforce (Sigaeva et al., 2022). Organisations would improve individual Gen Z employee retention strategies by using a conceptual framework for the generation engagement drivers (Pandita, 2022). The key engagement drivers included the perception of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), where positive views on CSR initiatives significantly enhanced employee engagement. Opportunities for employee development, such as skill enhancement and career growth, were crucial for maintaining engagement levels. A supportive organisational culture consistent with employee values also contributed to higher engagement. In addition, recognising and rewarding employee contributions were found to motivate and engage the workforce. Lastly, ensuring a healthy work-life balance was essential for job satisfaction and sustained engagement, particularly among employees. In line with Raslie and Ting (2021), Gen Z placed a high importance on work-life balance, desiring flexibility that allowed employees to manage personal and professional commitments effectively. The inclination towards meaningful work experiences motivated employees to apply for roles that suited their values and aspirations. Furthermore, understanding and addressing Gen Z work expectations was crucial for employers aiming to attract and retain this evolving workforce.

According to Pandita (2022), the perception of corporate social responsibility among Gen Z employees were well-established. The research findings accurately reflected reality, which could be applicable across various contexts. Moreover, as business dynamics changed and new generations entered the workforce, observing how the relationship between corporate responsibility and Gen Z changes over time was necessary. This relationship showed the importance of understanding how Gen Z employees perceived individual

organisations, as it significantly influenced personal work behaviour. Research by Taibah and Ho (2023) signified that Gen Z prioritised achieving a balance between work and family more than previous generations. Xueyun et al. (2023) stated that Gen Z employees, having experienced the Great Recession valued factors such as pay, benefits, job stability, flexibility, and work-life balance. As opposed to previous generations, Gen Z pursued opportunities for career growth and quickly lost interest in routine tasks. Therefore, organisations should assess the talents in their workforce and implement job rotation programmes. These programmes would allow employees to work in departments that support individual interests, thereby improving skill development and engagement.

The above-mentioned various exposures indicate that comprehending Generation Z's work expectations in the workplace holds significant importance for organisations aiming to foster a better work environment and improve collaboration. As the latest generation in the workplace, Generation Z holds unique expectations regarding their employment.

### Intergenerational challenges in the workplace

Sigaeva et al. (2022) found that Gen Y, born in the 1990s, shared similar beliefs and opinions with their parents (the older generation). Moreover, as Gen Z, which are the next cohort of employees enters the workforce, the expectations of employers, coworkers, and leaders concerning will possibly increase. In the workplace, individuals represented culture and leadership, which were inherently interconnected. This research's findings showed a stronger impact of leadership style on Gen Z employees. According to Trifan and Pantea (2023), technological advancements had transformed many aspects of daily life, prompting modern organisations to adopt proactive measures in the workplace. Employees often encounter similar difficulties when transitioning from traditional methods to more productive practices. Therefore, this research investigated the way in which the adoption of new technologies had affected the personal and professional lives of both Gen Y and Z. The findings provided valuable insights for employers, HR managers, recruiters, and policymakers. The understanding enabled the individual groups to adapt methods, plans, regulations, and initiatives to better address the needs and behaviour of these specific target populations.

According to the research of Raslie and Ting (2021), Gen Z and Y shared many common traits, such as a fondness for group projects, validation, definite norms, and having individual ideas taken seriously. These generations preferred in-person interactions as well as online communication that used images. Raslie and Ting (2021) also revealed that significant intergenerational challenges exist between Gen Y and Gen Z in the workplace. There were significant distinctions between some of the work and research habits. For example, Gen Y was more skilful than Gen Z at analysing data from the Internet and managing multiple projects at once. Although Gen Z expected more immediate input than

Gen Y, both age partners anticipated frequent feedback. In terms of communication style, both Gen Y and Z were friendly talkers who lacked assertiveness, valued relationships above tasks, as well as communicated slowly. The results showed that these generations possessed a certain amount of style-typing ability or the capacity to identify individual communication styles through peer comparison. Because more Gen Y oral presenters focused on delivering detailed information, an increasing number were also engaging in style-flexing, adapting individual messages to better connect with the target audience. Gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic level did not influence the communication style, signifying a greater influence from individual generational cohorts. The research by Taibah and Ho (2023) concluded that the flexible work option moderated two of the three correlations between the structural empowerment dimensions and contextual job performance of Gen Z. Therefore, managers need to consider how many flexible work arrangements the organisations would offer Gen Z employees. The comparison between these two generations is shown in Table 4.

The explanation provided was consistent with Lazányi and Bilan (2017), indicating that the differences in work expectations and values between Gen Z and older generations, such as Gen X and Baby Boomers, led to intergenerational challenges. Gen Z appeared to place high importance on trust, flexibility, and strong interpersonal relationships, while older generations might prioritise hierarchy and loyalty to their work to a greater extent. Variations in communication styles and work methods could lead to misunderstandings and tensions in the workplace. Furthermore, Gen Z reliance on digital technology might lead to some challenges in developing the interpersonal skills essential for successful teamwork. It was essential for organisations to recognise and address these intergenerational challenges to promote a harmonious and productive work environment for individuals of all age groups.

Gen Y and Z had shown to be highly receptive to technology, according to research conducted by Trifan and Pantea (2023). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the adoption of technology and personality traits such as optimism and inventiveness, still, a negative correlation existed between discomfort as well as insecurity. This research had shown that work-life balance for young employees benefitted from the acceptance of technology.

### The role of technology in Gen Z productivity

Lazányi and Bilan (2017) explained that technology significantly contributed to enhancing the productivity of Gen Z. As individuals who had grown up with digital tools, Gen Z were well-versed in using these tools for collaboration and communication. Given the easy access to information and online resources, this generation was able to manage time and tasks with greater efficiency. Furthermore, technology usage enabled individuals to maintain connections with colleagues and promote supportive social

relationships in the workplace. This result was in line with Raslie and Ting (2021), which emphasised the significance of technology for productivity, access to efficient information, and the ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. Therefore, proficiency in using digital tools facilitated prompt communication and collaboration, which corresponded with the preference for immediate feedback.

Gen Z capacity to effectively use technology to address challenges positively contributed to the entire work performance. Trifan and Pantea (2023) stated that adopting technology also enhanced work-life balance, further highlighting the role of technology in improving productivity. Despite the benefits of technology usage, over-dependency might present challenges in traditional work environments that could affect digital communication styles. This implied that effectively leveraging technology is essential to maximise the productivity of Gen Z and ensure their successful integration into the workforce.

### The significance of leadership style for Gen Z employees

Compared to previous generations, Gen Z employees had distinct attitudes towards individual co-employees in the workplace. Respect and trust for superiors were not granted, rather, these attributes were earned through outstanding work performance (Lazányi & Bilan, 2017). In the context of this research, Sigaeva et al. (2022) found that leadership style influenced the work engagement of Gen Z employees. Therefore, this research signified that both servant and authentic leadership styles might be promising leadership strategies for handling employees of the newest generation. As a new generation of employees entered the workforce, Gen Z had higher expectations from individual leaders, employees, and workplaces (Sigaeva et al. 2022).

The research of Pandita (2022) showed a positive correlation between job engagement and coworker relationships (COP), perceived supervisory support (PSS), as well as perceived organisational support (POS). The PSS had made the greatest impact on engaging with Gen Z compared to the other two variables. The result signified the importance of leadership in influencing employee performance, particularly among Gen Z. This research showed the importance of employers valuing the aspirations and principles of Gen Z workforce, respecting the ideas of the generation, and offering opportunities for professional advancement. In addition, the method could be used by HR managers to form employee engagement initiatives that reflect the aims and values of Gen Z employees. The conclusions of the research had important complications for businesses hoping to successfully engage and keep Gen Z employees in the future. The other investigation by Zehetner et al. (2022) found significant differences in leadership style preferences among Gen Z representatives from different cultural backgrounds. Moreover, the results signified that this generation had different expectations for future leaders, favouring transformational leadership over transactional, financial, and sanctions-based leadership. This information

was relevant for managers and leaders in a variety of activities. Following the discussion, representatives of other cultures had distinct expectations. Supervisors collaborating with staff members from diverse cultural backgrounds should understand the different demands relating to the members. Based on Gaan and Shin (2023), resonant leadership might be important to controlling the psychological traits most prevalent in the upcoming Gen Z cohorts, producing favourable results at work. According to Sigaeva et al. (2022), interactions with co-employees particularly those with leaders had a big effect on how people behaved at work, and these results correlated with other research. In addition, the current investigation of Taibah and Ho (2023) had produced significant experimental data that would influence future leadership research, employee structural empowerment, flexible work arrangements, and the performance of Gen Z employees. From a practical view, the findings offered managers, policymakers, and organisations helpful information by showing the proper structural empowerment required to improve contextual work performance of Gen Z. The results of this research could also help companies carefully balance the advantages and disadvantages of developing policies and assist staff members of all generations including Gen Z, in understanding individual full potential. These steps showed how crucial the role of leaders is in shaping the work habits of Gen Z employees.

### Impact on intention to stay or quit: Integrating findings

The findings discussed in the previous sections described that unmet work expectations, such as work flexibility and development opportunities, could significantly influence Gen Z decision to stay with or leave organisations (Taibah & Ho, 2023). This was consistent with previous research, indicating a connection between satisfaction with work expectations and the intention to remain in a position (Fan et al., 2023; Lazányi & Bilan, 2017; Pandita & Khatwani, 2022; Xueyun et al., 2023). Furthermore, the role of technology in enhancing productivity was crucial for Gen Z. The lack of sufficient technological tools could lead to frustration and reduced engagement, increasing the possibility of employees deciding to leave. Intergenerational challenges and inadequate leadership styles also served as factors that could affect retention. Gaan and Shin (2023), Lazányi and Bilan (2017), Pandita and Khatwani (2022), Sigaeva et al. (2022), Taibah and Ho (2023), and Zehetner et al. (2022) emphasised that leadership had a significant impact on the attitudes of Gen Z employees in the workplace. A factor influencing this generation was the decision to stay, but organisations might benefit from refining employee retention strategy by using a conceptual framework that identifies major drivers of Gen Z engagement (Pandita & Khatwani, 2022; Sigaeva et al. 2022). The importance of increasing good interpersonal relations among colleagues was to improve cooperation, organisational commitment, and general well-being. These kinds of practices changed the minds of the employees from leaving (Lazányi & Bilan, 2017). Working with Gen Z

employees presented a managerial problem that businesses just resolved. In addition, the unique characteristics of this generation of employees necessitated an immediate refurbishment of organisational management expertise. According to Fan et al. (2023), employees among Gen Z might show work withdrawal behaviour as a result of unlawful tasks that could lead to leaving organisations.

Gaan and Shin (2023) conducted research that used social exchange and identity theories to examine the relationship between resonant leadership, self-efficacy, organisational identification, work performance, as well as turnover intentions in Gen Z. Based on the experimental evidence, companies could design appropriate intervention mechanisms to improve productivity and lower cohorts propensity of Gen Z to leave. This research was an innovative attempt to form a thorough theoretical framework that offers a wide range of possibilities for further research into the mechanisms controlling the expectations of Gen Z cohorts.

Positive working conditions were associated with better levels of contentment and quality of life, both of which were indicators of well-being, according to research by Xueyun et al. (2023). As a result, Gen Z performed better at work and was more engaged, lowering the turnover rate. Receiving both material and non-material benefits directly decreases the intentions of employees to quit.

### Limitations of the review

Despite the included research and the significant contribution of the review, interpreting the conclusions of the investigation with various limitations is advisable. Firstly, there was a lack of research on the influence of cross-cultural use, making it impossible to assess whether cultural participation influenced the work behavior of Gen Z. Secondly, the research proposed examining workplace behaviors of Gen Z across a variety of more specific cultural backgrounds. Thirdly, this research only accepted articles written in English, and future investigations should consider adopting a broader definition of language in individual research.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this review improved the overview of Gen Z in the workplace by identifying existing research and opening avenues for more specific research. This study identified four primary themes concerning Gen Z in the workplace, namely job expectations, the role of technology, intergenerational challenges, and the significance of leadership style. Organisations that did not address these themes were likely to experience an increase in intention to stay or quit. The finding provided important insights for leaders and managers as they worked to develop policies and practices aimed at improving workforce retention among this generation. Furthermore, the review described the need for customised strategies to effectively engage this evolving workforce. Future research should explore cross-cultural differences and the long-term impact of workplace integration. The findings

provided valuable recommendations for organisations, emphasising the need to adjust workplace policies to prioritise flexibility, adopt digital tools for collaboration, and ensure that leaders were educated on inclusive practices in line with the values of Gen Z. Lastly, the initiatives aimed at promoting intergenerational understanding could assist in enhancing collaborations in the workplace.
