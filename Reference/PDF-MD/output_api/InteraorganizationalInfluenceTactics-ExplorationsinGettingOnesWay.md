The tactics used by people at work to influence their superiors, co-workers, and subordinates were investigated in two studies. In the first study, 165 lower-level managers wrote essays describing an incident in which they influenced either their bosses, co-workers, or subordinates. Through content analysis, a total of 370 influence tactics grouped into 14 categories were identified. The tactics ranged from the use of rational discussion through the use of exchange tactics to the use of clandestine tactics. In a second study, the 370 influence tactics were rewritten into a 58-item questionnaire. New respondents described the extent to which they used each item to influence their bosses ( $n = 225$ ), co-workers ( $n = 285$ ), or subordinates ( $n = 244$ ). Based on a factor analysis of the questionnaire, eight dimensions of influence were found: assertiveness, ingratiation, rationality, sanctions, exchange, upward appeals, blocking, and coalitions. It was found that the frequency with which each influence dimension was used related to the relative power of the respondents and their targets of influence, the reasons for exercising influence, the resistance of the target person, the organizational status of the respondents, organizational size, and whether the organization was unionized. Sex of the respondents and sex of the respondents' bosses, however, were not related to the choice of influence tactics in the present study.

Organizational psychologists have not been particularly interested in studying the ways in which people at work influence their colleagues and superiors to obtain personal benefits or to satisfy organizational goals. For the most part, interest has centered on the ways subordinates can be influenced to improve subordinate productivity and morale. This latter use of influence is customarily called the study of leadership, whereas the former can be called the study of organizational politics.

A consequence of this focus on leadership is that there is little systematic information available about how people use power to influence their colleagues or superiors. With

but few exceptions (e.g., Izraeli, 1975; Schein, 1977), our thinking about this topic is guided by anecdotal evidence or armchair speculations that have been organized into rational classifications of power tactics (e.g., Etzioni, 1968, pp. 94–109; French & Raven, 1959). One problem with these classifications of power tactics, as Raven (1974) has pointed out, is that they overlap with each other, though each varies in the number of influence dimensions that are described. A further problem with existing classifications of power tactics is that when influence acts are actually studied, it is found that people do not exercise influence in ways predicted by rational classification schemes. This point was first explicitly made in a study by Goodchild, Quadrado, and Raven (Note 1) in which college students wrote brief essays on the topic "How I got my way." It was found that many of the influence tactics described by these students could not be classified into preexisting categories. Sev-

eral tactics thought to be basic when classifying influence, such as the use of expert power, were not even mentioned by the students.

There is a need, therefore, for empirical studies of the use of influence within organizations. The purpose of this article is to report two studies that sought to examine the tactics of influence used by people at work when attempting to change the behavior of their superiors, co-workers, and subordinates. In the first study, the range of tactics that people use at work was identified by applying content analysis to written descriptions by managers of their attempts to influence their bosses, co-workers, or subordinates. The second study sought to identify through factor analysis the dimensions of influence underlying the specific tactics that were uncovered in the first study.

## Study 1: Determining Intraorganizational Influence Tactics

### Method

The data for this study were collected from 165 respondents, 25% women and 75% men. All respondents were taking graduate business courses part-time, in the evening. They were told to refer to their current employment experience when supplying the requested information.

The respondents were employed mainly in managerial roles as engineers, technicians, and professionals. Since most respondents came from different organizations, there were almost as many organizations as respondents represented.

Respondents were asked to describe an incident in which they actually succeeded in getting either their boss, a co-worker, or a subordinate to do something they wanted; 62 described how they got their way with their boss, 49 with a co-worker, and 54 with a sub-

ordinate. The reason for the unequal distribution of respondents over status levels was that fewer respondents had subordinates or co-workers than had bosses.

In their description of an incident, each respondent wrote in essay form what they wanted from a target person, what they did, whether there was resistance from the target, and what further influence tactics were used in response to resistance from the target. Each respondent also completed a structured questionnaire containing demographic and specific organizational job-situation questions.

The incidents were sorted first in terms of the goal sought from the target person. This sorting yielded five general categories of goals: *assistance with own job*—obtaining the assistance of the target in helping the respondent do his or her job, when it was not part of the target's legitimate job duties; *get others to do their job*—getting the target to do his or her own work; *obtain benefits*—goals that personally benefited the respondent, such as salary increase, promotion, and improved work schedule; *initiate change*—initiating new organizational programs and systems or improving the coordination of organizational activities (e.g., changing a scheduling procedure); and *improve performance*—improving the target's on-the-job performance.

These goals varied as a function of the target's job status, as shown in Table 1. Respondents sought mostly self-interest goals from their superiors. The primary goal sought from co-workers was to get assistance with the respondent's own job. The most prevalent reason for influencing subordinates was to get them to do their jobs. Finally, the goal of initiating change was sought both from bosses and from subordinates in almost equal proportion. However, the changes sought from superiors focused on job-related organizational changes, such as launching a new accounting procedure or starting a special project. But with subordinates, the changes sought dealt with job performance, such as changes in the way a job should be done or the manner of working in the organization.

Next, the influence tactics reported by the respondents in attempting to achieve these goals were identified. A total of 370 influence tactics were reported by the 165 respondents. The authors sorted these tactics into 14 categories (see Table 2). Consensus among the coders was used as the criterion for assigning a given tactic to a

category. The 14 categories ranged from the use of administrative sanctions and personal threats through the use of logic and rational discussions to clandestine, dependency appeal, and ingratiating tactics. The individual tactics illustrating these 14 categories are also shown in Table 2. To determine the reliability of the assignment of items to these 14 categories, three coders who were not associated with the research independently sorted the 370 influence tactics into the 14 categories. Raters 1 and 2 agreed on the placement of items 61% of the time; Raters 1 and 3 agreed 64% of the time; and Raters 2 and 3 agreed 65% of the time. Since there were 14 categories into which any item could be placed, the degree of agreement between the three raters suggests modestly high reliability for the classification scheme. The areas of disagreement between the raters involved primarily the three categories "weak ask," "explain," and "request."

In addition to identifying influence tactics, the analyses of Study 1 focused on the correlates of the 14 categories of influence. To this end, a unit weight of 1 was assigned if the respondent reported using any of the items comprising a given influence tactic category; a score of 0 was assigned if none of the items comprising a category were mentioned. Thus, each respondent had 14 scores of 1 or 0. Next, multivariate analyses of variance, which if significant were followed by univariate analyses, were carried out to examine the relationship among the 14 categories of influence, the status of the target person, and the goals sought by respondents in exercising influence.

The influence tactics used by the respondents varied with the goal sought from the target person. When the goal was self-interest, the most frequently reported tactics were self-presentation and personal negative actions; when the goal was to initiate change, the most

<sup>a</sup> Percentage of the 370 tabulated influence tactics reported by respondents.

frequently reported tactics were the use of logic and rational discussions; when the goal was to improve a target's performance, respondents reported using administrative sanctions, training, and simply demanding compliance. Finally, when the goal was to get others to do the respondent's own work, the most frequently reported tactic was the use of requests. All of the above findings were statistically reliable beyond the .05 level.

The kinds of influence tactics used by the respondents varied with the power of the target person. Respondents significantly more often used the tactics of self-presentation, supporting data, and coalitions when attempting to influence their bosses. Different tactics, however, were used to influence subordinates; then respondents significantly more often used clandestine tactics, administrative sanctions, training, demanding, and explaining. Finally, the data showed that only one tactic was significantly associated with influencing co-workers—the tactic of requesting help. At the .10 level, however, the tactics of exchange, requests, and rewards were also associated with influencing co-workers.

The use of influence tactics also varied with the amount of resistance shown by target persons. When the respondents stated that the target at first refused to comply, the subsequent actions of respondents included an increase in persistence and the use of personal negative actions. Additionally, when confronting resisting bosses and co-workers, the respondents reported an increase in the use of coalitions with fellow employees. If the person resisting was a subordinate, however, the respondents reported using more administrative sanctions such as giving unsatisfactory performance evaluations.

### Results

The findings of the study suggest that in organizational settings the choice of influence tactics is associated with what the respondents are trying to get from the target person, the amount of resistance shown, and the power of the target person. Combining these findings suggests that administrative sanctions and personal negative actions are more likely to be used when the target is a subordinate who is actively resisting the request of the manager and when the reasons for exercising influence are based on the respondent's role in the organization (e.g., improve target's performance).

It is also important to note that many of the tactics reported by the respondents have received little mention in the organizational literature (e.g., the use of deceit, self-presentation, and clandestine tactics). In fact, the tactics shown in Table 2 represent a bewildering combination of several classification schemes from the exchange theories of

Michener and Schwertfeger (1972) to the schemes described by French and Raven (1959) and by Cartwright (1965, pp. 1–47). It is clear that the many influence tactics described here do not fit easily into any single classification scheme currently found in the literature on power usage. Based on these findings, we believe that new ways of classifying such tactics are needed that use the actual influence behaviors of organizational members as the starting point. An effort in this direction is reported in the next study.

## Study 2

### Method

Many of the 14 categories of influence tactics in the first study overlapped either conceptually or empirically or both (e.g., "weak ask" vs. "request"). The purpose of Study 2 was to determine the factor structure of the tactics found in the previous study. To this end, 58 items were developed from Study 1's tactics. These items were included in a questionnaire administered to 754 employed respondents. Respondents were asked to describe on a 5-point scale how frequently during the past 6 months they had used each item to influence a target person at work. The 5-point scale had verbal anchors as follows: usually use this tactic to influence him/her (5), frequently use this tactic to influence him/her (4), occasionally use this tactic to influence him/her (3), seldom use this tactic to influence him/her (2), and never use this tactic to influence him/her (1).

There were three forms of the questionnaire: One asked respondents to describe how they influenced their bosses, another asked how they influenced their co-workers, and the third asked how they influenced their subordinates. The instructions read:

This questionnaire is a way of obtaining information about how you go about changing your boss's (or co-worker's or subordinate's) mind so that he or she agrees with you. Below are described various ways of doing this. Please do not answer in terms of what you would like to do.

Respondents were also told that if the tactics did not apply in their work to leave the space blank; blank responses were coded as "never used this tactic."

*Sample.* The respondents were drawn from the same managerial population as in Study 1 and were taking graduate business courses part-time; 690 were enrolled in evening courses at Temple University and 64 were enrolled at the Bernard Baruch Graduate Center in New York City. Of the 754 respondents, 225 described how they influenced their bosses, 285 described how they influenced co-workers, and 244 described how they influenced subordinates.

*Reasons for exercising influence.* In addition to describing how frequently each influence tactic was used, a separate scale presented respondents with five

possible reasons for influencing the target person. These reasons were based on those found in Study 1 and read as follows: (a) have my boss (co-worker or subordinate) assist me on my job or do some of my work; (b) assign work to my boss (co-worker or subordinate) or tell him or her what to do; (c) have my boss (co-worker or subordinate) give me benefits, such as raises, better hours of work, time off, better job assignments, and so on; (d) have my boss (co-worker or subordinate) do his or her own work better or do what they are supposed to do; (e) have my boss (co-worker or subordinate) accept my ideas for changes, for example, to accept a new way of doing the work more efficiently or a new program or project.

For each of the five reasons, the respondents were asked to rate on a 5-point scale ranging from "very often" (5) to "never" (1) how frequently each reason had been the cause of their trying to influence the target person to do something.

Parallelizing the findings of Study 1, the reasons for exercising influence varied with whether the target person was a superior, co-worker, or subordinate. Table 3 shows that the major reasons for influencing subordinates were that respondents more frequently attempted to assign them work, to improve their task performance, and to have them assist the respondents in their own work ( $p < .01$  compared to co-workers or superiors). Superiors were influenced most frequently to receive personal benefits ( $p < .01$ ). Finally, respondents reported that they attempted to influence both their subordinates and their superiors with almost equal frequency to convince them to initiate change. This last result was also found in Study 1.

*Additional background data.* The questionnaire also obtained information about the sex of the respondent, the sex of the respondent's boss, whether the organization was unionized, the number of persons employed in the respondent's work unit, and the job level of the respondent. Job level information was based on the respondent's description of his or her own work. This information was coded into four groups: clerical/sales, professional (e.g., engineer, computer technician), first-line and middle managers (e.g., supervisor, manager of clerical unit, etc.), and top-level managers (e.g., vice president of marketing).

### Results

The 58 influence tactic items were factor analyzed using a principal component factor solution, with iterations for communality and varimax rotation. Forced two-factor through eight-factor solutions were carried out to aid in interpreting the findings.

Factor analyses were carried out for the entire sample and separately for each of the three target status levels (superior, co-worker, subordinate). This was done to examine the possibility that dimensions of influence would emerge at each target status level that did not emerge in the overall analysis. A second reason for carrying out separate factor analyses at each target status level was to ensure that any factors that emerged in the combined analysis also appeared in at least one of the separate factor analyses. It was assumed that a factor that did not appear in any of the separate analyses, yet appeared in the overall analysis, only reflected differences between target status levels in the exercise of influence.

The factor analysis of the entire sample yielded six interpretable factors.<sup>1</sup> These six factors accounted for 38% of the total item variance. Table 4 lists the 58 tactics presented in the questionnaire and their loadings on each of the six factors. The data in Table 4 are based on the overall factor analysis utilizing all 754 respondents.

<sup>1</sup> One additional factor was dropped, since it did not emerge in any of the separate factor analyses by target status level.

<sup>a</sup> Data based on factor analysis of tactics used to influence superiors.

<sup>b</sup> Data based on factor analysis of tactics used to influence subordinates.

Factor 1 is identified by highest loadings on the influence tactics, including demanding, ordering, and setting deadlines. This factor is labeled *Assertiveness*. The factor emerged as a dimension of influence at all target status levels (superior, co-worker, and subordinate).

Factor 2 is described by the highest loadings on weak and nonobtrusive influence tactics. Included here were such tactics as "acting humble" and "making the other person feel important." This factor is labeled *Ingratiation*. The factor emerged as a dimension of influence at all levels of target status.

Factor 3 is characterized by loadings on the use of rationality influence tactics and is labeled *Rationality*. It includes such tactics as "writing a detailed plan" and "explaining the reasons for my request." This factor emerged at each target status level. In the analysis of tactics directed toward subordinates, however, additional items that involved group pressure also loaded highly on this factor. These latter items will be discussed subsequently.

Factor 4 involved the use of administrative sanctions to induce compliance. Tactics with high loadings included "prevented salary increases" and "threatened job security." This factor is labeled *Sanctions*. It emerged as a dimension of influence at all levels of target status.

Factor 5 loaded on tactics involving the

exchange of positive benefits. Included here were such tactics as "offering an exchange" and "offering to make personal sacrifices." This factor is labeled *Exchange of Benefits*. This factor only emerged in the factor analysis of influence tactics directed toward superiors.

Factor 6 is described by loadings on tactics that bring additional pressure for conformity on the target by invoking the influence of higher levels in the organization. Included here were such tactics as "making a formal appeal to higher levels" and "obtaining the informal support of higher-ups." This factor only emerged in the factor analysis of influence tactics directed toward superiors; it is labeled *Upward Appeal*.

Two additional factors (Factors 7 and 8) did not emerge in the overall factor analysis but were found in the subanalyses. It was decided to retain these factors for heuristic purposes.

Factor 7 emerged in the factor analysis of influence directed toward superiors. Items that loaded on this factor included "engaging in a work slowdown" and "threatening to stop working with the target person." Essentially, these tactics are attempts to stop the target person from carrying out some action by various kinds of blocking tactics. This factor is labeled *Blocking*.

Factor 8 emerged from the factor analysis of tactics directed toward subordinates.

Note. N = 754.

Items in this factor were part of the previously described factor Rationality. However, this subset of items described the use of steady pressure for compliance by "obtaining the support of co-workers" and by "obtaining the support of subordinates." This is labeled *Coalitions*.

*Scale construction.* To aid further analysis, scales were constructed whose items were selected to represent each of the eight dimensions of influence.<sup>2</sup> Selection was made on the basis of two criteria. First, items were selected that loaded over .40 on a given dimension and did not load above .25 on any of the remaining dimensions. Second, from the pool of items that were selected to represent each dimension, items were selected based on an examination of each item's correlation with other items representing the factor and their correlations with items in the remaining factors. High item intercorrelation within a factor and low item intercorrelation with the remaining items were used as the final criteria for selecting items.

To determine the intercorrelation between the eight scales, correlation matrices were first computed at each of the three status levels. Next, all intercorrelations were converted to their z' equivalents, averaged, and then reconverted to product-moment correlations. This procedure provides an estimate of the correlation between the eight scales, with the variance attributable to target status partialled out. As shown in Table 5, there was a fair degree of independence among the factors, with the exception of the relationship between Ingratiation and Exchange tactics ( $r = .49$ ).

The remaining factors show reasonably low levels of intercorrelation, with rs ranging from .03 to .36. It should be noted that the individual correlation matrices at each status level closely paralleled the averaged findings reported in Table 5.

Table 6 presents the reliability of the eight scale scores (coefficient alpha) for each target status level. With the exception of low reliability for the use of Blocking tactics with subordinates and co-workers, the remaining factor scores have satisfactory reliabilities.

### Correlates of Influence Tactics

*Target status.* Table 7 shows the means and standard deviations of each influence dimension as a function of the status of the target. Seven of the eight dimensions were significantly associated with the relative status of the target. Basically, the findings suggest that as the status of the target person increased, respondents placed more reliance on rationality tactics. An analysis using Duncan's multiple-range test found that Assertive tactics and Sanctions were used more often to influence subordinates than co-workers or superiors ( $ps < .01$ ). The tactics of Ingratiation, Exchange of Benefits, and Upward Appeal were used with equal frequency among subordinates and co-workers but significantly less often when attempting to influence superiors ( $p < .01$ ). Finally, respondents reported that they used Rationality tactics more frequently to convince superiors than co-workers or subordinates ( $p < .01$ ). As will be shown later, these differences in choice of tactics in part reflect the fact that respondents have different reasons for influencing target persons at different status levels.

*Goals.* It will be recalled that respondents in the present study rated the importance of five possible reasons for exercising influence. To determine whether different combinations of tactics were used as the reasons for influencing varied, a set of stepwise regression analyses was performed. These stepwise regression analyses examined the relation between the eight tactic scores and the rated importance of each reason for

exercising influence. A restriction put on the analysis was that only tactics that correlated significantly ( $p < .05$ ) with a given reason were entered into the regression analysis. Since we have already found that the type of tactic used and the reasons for exercising influence both varied with the status of the target person, separate regression analyses were carried out at each target status level.

Table 8 shows these findings in terms of the particular combination of influence tactics that best predicted each reason for exercising influence. In addition, Table 8 presents the multiple correlations of these influence tactics with each reason for exercising influence.

Table 8 shows that at all target status levels, the respondent's choice of influence

Note. Tactics are listed in order of their entry into the stepwise multiple regression equations. All correlations are significant beyond the .05 level.

tactics varied with the respondents' reasons for exercising influence. That is, respondents who frequently sought personal assistance from target persons used Ingratiation tactics; respondents who frequently assigned work to target persons used Assertiveness; and respondents who frequently tried to improve a target person's performance used Assertiveness and Rationality tactics. Fi-

nally, respondents who frequently tried to convince target persons to accept new ideas used Rationality tactics.

Another finding of interest in Table 8 is that respondents showed the least variation in choice of tactics when attempting to influence their subordinates. No matter what the reason for influencing subordinates, the use of Assertiveness was associated with each of the five reasons and accounted for the most variance for each reason. In contrast, when influencing co-workers and superiors, the use of Assertiveness was associated only with two of the five reasons.

*Other situational factors.* So far it has been shown that use of the eight dimensions of influence was associated with the relative power of the target person and the reasons why the respondents wanted to influence the target person. In this section we examine the relationship between the use of tactics and five personal or situational characteristics of the respondent: sex, level in the organization, whether the respondent's unit was unionized, number of people in respondent's work unit, and sex of respondent's boss.

The findings showed that the respondent's own level in the organization was closely associated with use of influence tactics. Compared to those with low job status, respondents with higher job status reported greater use of Rationality and Assertiveness tactics when influencing both their subordinates and their superiors ( $p_s < .01$ ). In addition, respondents with higher job status used Sanctions more frequently and sought aid from their superiors less frequently when influencing their subordinates ( $p_s < .01$ ). Thus, as the respondents' own job status rose, they were more likely to use more direct tactics of influence and be less dependent upon superiors.

Size of work unit also related to the use of tactics on subordinates. In large work units, respondents more frequently used Assertiveness ( $p < .01$ ), Sanctions ( $p < .01$ ), and Upward Appeal ( $p < .05$ ) when influencing subordinates. These findings are consistent with the general idea that as the number of persons in a work unit increases, a greater reliance is placed on strong and impersonal means of control.

Finally, the presence of unions was associated with the use of certain tactics. If the organization was unionized, respondents were more likely to use Ingratiating tactics to influence subordinates ( $p < .01$ ), to avoid the use of Assertiveness when influencing co-workers ( $p < .05$ ), and to use Rationality tactics less frequently ( $p < .01$ ) and Blocking tactics more frequently ( $p < .01$ ) when influencing bosses.

There were no significant relations associated with the sex of the respondent and the sex of the respondent's boss in terms of the frequency of use of the eight dimensions of influence. Thus, in the present study men and women chose similar tactics when attempting to get their way.

## Discussion

In Study 1, influence tactics were sorted into 14 categories, but we suspected that a more parsimonious classification system was likely to exist. The results of Study 2 yielded eight dimensions of influence.

Four of these dimensions emerged at all status levels. These dimensions were Assertiveness, Sanctions, Ingratiation, and Rationality. The remaining dimensions were uniquely associated with influencing either superiors or subordinates. The tactics of Exchange of Benefits, Blocking, and Upward Appeal emerged when respondents described how they influenced their bosses. These dimensions did not appear in the analysis of influence tactics used among subordinates. Finally, the use of Coalitions tactics appeared only when respondents described how they influenced their subordinates.

Unfortunately, there are few studies available with which to compare the present findings. Within organizational settings, the major empirical studies of influence tactics have been based on the Ohio State-Navy leadership studies (Fleishman, 1973). These studies could identify only two dimensions of influence—consideration and initiating structure. However, this early program of research was only concerned with how leaders exercised influence over subordinates and was not concerned with the use of

influence tactics among peers and bosses. Hence, the range of influence tactics used in that early research covered fewer areas than those included here.

Other factorial studies of influence tactics have focused on dimensions of influence in interpersonal settings (Falbo, 1977; Kipnis, Cohen, & Catalano, Note 2). These studies have uncovered only two or three dimensions of influence. For example, Kipnis et al. reported that dating couples used three dimensions of influence—strong, weak, and rational—as ways of changing their dating partner's behavior. The items loading on these three dimensions closely resemble the dimensions we have labeled *Assertiveness*, *Rationality*, and *Ingratiation* tactics. Thus, instead of acting "more loving" in order to influence, organizational members act "humble" and offer to "make sacrifices." The parallel is clearly there. The additional factors found in the present study suggest that organizational resources extend the range of tactics that organizational members can use. Thus, organizational members can invoke formal sanctions or the added authority of higher management as compliance-gaining strategies.

It is recognized, of course, that findings presented here are based on self-report measures and require replication using different methodologies. Nevertheless, the picture portrayed by these data is of organizational members actively seeking to influence peers, superiors, and subordinates for a variety of reasons, some personal and some based on their management roles. This picture supports the view of those who argue that organizational leadership is more complicated than is represented in organizational behavior textbooks (Kochan, Schmidt, & DeCotis, 1976). Such texts mainly focus on the ways in which higher levels in the organization influence lower levels. This is called the leadership process. In fact, we would suggest that everyone is influencing everyone else in organizations, regardless of job title. People seek benefits, information, satisfactory job performance, the chance to do better than others, to be left alone, cooperation, and many other outcomes too numerous to mention.

In fact, there may be very little difference in the frequency with which people try to influence their bosses, co-workers, and subordinates, given all these various reasons for trying to influence others. What shows remarkable variation, however, are the kinds of tactics that are chosen when trying to obtain these various outcomes. The present article has shown that these tactics vary with the particular wants of the influencing agent and his or her degree of control over the target of influence. The implications of these findings for the understanding of organizational politics remain to be explored.

As a final point, the scales that have been developed to measure the various dimensions of influence can be useful in further research. Even though the use of influence within organizations is a topic of considerable interest, there have been few systematic attempts to develop a means of measuring such behavior. The present dimensions provide the potential for profiling the use of influence in a variety of organizational settings and at different levels as well as between various groups.
