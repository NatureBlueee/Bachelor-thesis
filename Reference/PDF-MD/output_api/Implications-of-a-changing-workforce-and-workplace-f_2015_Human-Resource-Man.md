## ABSTRACT

We forecast how HRM practice and HR research on fairness in the workplace will need to change in light of several specific global workplace trends, namely, increases in workplace diversity and globalization, technology mediated relationships, individualized psychological contracts, and service-related jobs. After describing these trends, we illustrate how the meaning of fairness and worker expectations regarding fairness may be changing in response. We further discuss how those changes will impact HR management.

Much has been made in research outlets and the popular press of the changing nature of the workforce (e.g., demographics, skill levels), the workplace (e.g., working remotely), and work itself (e.g., role of technology) (Cartwright, 2003). It is clear that these changes have had an impact on the roles of the human resource (HR) practitioner who now deals with a more diverse and dispersed workforce. What is not always as clear is the extent to which these changes call into question the foundational knowledge on which HR practice is based. The applicability of "what we know" to the changing workforce, workplace, and work cannot be taken for granted; an examination of how these trends impact that knowledge and the ways we use that knowledge to design effective HR systems is needed. The goal of this paper is to focus specifically on that examination in the area of organizational justice or fairness in the workplace. The question we seek to address is: Do key trends require us to revisit what is known about fairness in the workplace or to consider our approach to practice differently?

While a detailed review of organizational justice theory and research on workplace fairness is beyond the scope of this paper, there is general agreement that judgments of fairness involve four distinct types of perceptions (Colquitt, 2001). *Distributive justice perceptions* relate to whether the outcomes an individual receives (e.g., hiring, promotion and raise decisions) are viewed as fair. *Procedural justice perceptions* relate to whether the procedures used to determine those outcomes (e.g., assessments, managerial discretion) are fair, and involve considerations of the consistency of the process, opportunities for input or voice, and job relevance, among others. *Interpersonal justice perceptions* are evaluations of whether one feels treated with dignity and respect in the context of a decision. *Informational justice perceptions* involve whether one feels informed as to what is occurring and given an adequate explanation as to why it occurred. Interpersonal and informational justices are often described jointly as *interactional justice*. There is a sizeable body of research on how these perceptions relate to workplace outcomes, with meta analyses demonstrating links to job satisfaction, organizational commitment, evaluation of authority, organizational citizenship behavior, withdrawal, and performance (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001; Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, & Ng, 2001).

On the practice side, while some argue that insufficient attention has been paid to interventions to enhance perceptions of justice in the workplace (Greenberg, 2009), many others note there is a large body of practical advice for improving justice (Gilliland, 2009). Attention has been paid to how to design and implement HR systems so as to increase fairness perceptions (e.g., increasing voice

perceptions; *Cawley, Keeping, & Levy, 1998*; *Linna et al., 2011*) and to procedures and training for managers on how to mitigate perceptions of unfairness when they do arise (e.g., grievance procedures, *Davy, Stewart, & Anderson, 1992*).

Even though much is known about organizational justice and implementing fair practices, enduring changes in the workplace can affect the applicability of this research base and the usefulness of interventions. That is, as workers and the work environment change, so too must managers and HR systems to respond to those changes. Our goal in this paper is to illustrate the many ways in which workplace trends may be affecting what individuals perceive as fair, what they expect as fair treatment, how fairness perceptions affect workplace outcomes, and what managers and HR practitioners need to do to ensure positive perceptions of actions and decisions. We specifically focus on four trends: greater diversity and globalization, increased use of technology, greater individualization and flexibility in employer–employee relationships, and the expansion of the service industry. We focus on these particular trends because they are documented as relatively enduring changes to the work landscape rather than passing fads, and because each has particular implications for how we think about fairness in the workplace. In the next section, we describe these trends. This is followed by a discussion of how they may be affecting perceptions of the fairness of HR related decisions and practices. We end with some overarching conclusions regarding changes in workplace fairness perceptions.

## 1. Workplace trends

Our first trend of focus is the *increase in globalization and domestic diversity in the workplace*. The workforce is now thought of as global, with a rise in international trade of goods and services resulting in a global consumer base and the internationalization and outsourcing of both low- and high-skilled jobs resulting in a cross-cultural workforce (*Karoly & Panis, 2004*). Investment in foreign economies continues to grow (*United Nations Commission on Trade and Development, 2008*), suggesting that the workforce will continue to globalize. The workforce is also changing in terms of domestic diversity in the U.S. and elsewhere, with increased parity of employment in many different industries for women (*Karoly & Panis, 2004*) and ethnic minority individuals (*Shore et al., 2009*). The meaning of diversity is also expanding, as companies are beginning to recognize the needs of a workforce that is increasingly diverse in many different ways, including (but not limited to): age, sexual orientation, and disability status (*Riche & Mor Barak, 2005*). Overall, evidence points toward a workforce that is changing in its composition and increasingly includes a diverse set of needs that must be addressed by managers and HR systems, raising new questions about fair treatment.

A second trend is the *increase in technology-mediated relationships in the workplace*, from pre-organizational entry to post-organizational exit. More and more organizations first interact with potential applicants via technology (job boards, virtual career centers, corporate web sites; *Jones & Dages, 2003*) and many maintain a technology-mediated relationship with applicants through the early stages of the hiring process (see *Tippins & Adler, 2011*, for comprehensive treatment of research on this topic and *Reynolds & Weiner, 2009*, for treatment of the associated practical issues). Increasingly, onboarding and training are largely technologically mediated (e.g., *Chu & Chu, 2011*; *Salas & Cannon-Bowers, 2001*). Many work relationships are at least partially mediated by technology (email, texting, skyping as key communication methods; *Mackenzie, 2010*; *Strohmeier, 2007*), and in some cases, relationships are entirely technologically mediated, such as with virtual teams (*Axtell, Fleck, & Turner, 2004*; *Lipnack & Stamps, 2000*). Virtuality in work relationships is essentially a continuum (*Hertel, Geister, & Konradt, 2005*; *Martins, Gilson, & Maynard, 2004*) with relationships varying in the extent of their face-to-face communication. Further, virtual teams themselves vary in the extent to which they use different forms of technology-mediated communication and the effectiveness of those tools (*Ou, Davison, Zhong, & Liang, 2010*). Technology has also become part and parcel of organizational control systems due to the widespread use of electronic monitoring (e.g., internet, phone, video, location sensing technologies) across a wide range of job types (*Chen & Ross, 2005*). In sum, technology-mediated relationships are now ubiquitous in the workplace, and hence it is important to consider how that change may affect fairness perceptions of work-related decisions and policies.

A third trend is the *changing nature of the employee-organization relationship (EOR)* (*Coyle-Shapiro & Shore, 2007*). Employers and employees make decisions regarding their investment in the relationship, what they are willing to provide, and what they expect in return (*Tsui, Pearce, Porter, & Tripoli, 1997*). Much of the recent work on the EOR has focused on the psychological contract, or the specific reciprocal obligations and commitments that individuals believe to arise from an exchange relationship (*Rousseau, 1998*), including transactional (salary, benefits and other monetary exchanges) and relational (opportunities for development and job security) aspects (*Coyle-Shapiro & Kessler, 2000*).

There is evidence that EOR investments and expectations are changing (e.g., *Atkinson, 2002*; *Cullinane & Dondon, 2006*). A US Department of Labor report (*Karoly & Panis, 2004*) note that shifting demographic patterns, the pace of technological change and economic globalization all contribute to less standardized and more individualized employee–employer relationships. There is an increase in individualized psychological contracts or idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) which are employment terms individuals negotiate for themselves (*Rousseau, 2001*), such as personal flexibility in work schedules, special development opportunities (*Hornung, Rousseau, & Glaser, 2008*) and customized job content (*Hornung, Rousseau, Glaser, Angerer, & Weigl, 2010*). Beyond the individualized contract, changes in what is offered and expected with regard to pensions (*Gough & Arkani, 2011*) and work hours (*Van Emmerik & Sanders, 2005*) indicate overall changes in EOR expectations.

A final trend we focus on is *increases in the service sector*. Service positions primarily involve “the provision of human value added in the form of labour, advice, managerial skill, entertainment, training, intermediation and the like” (*OECD, 2000, p. 7*). The service industry includes an eclectic array of jobs, including (but not limited to) retail associates, real estate agents, doctors, and financial advisors. Beginning around the 1960s and continuing to the present day, developed countries have seen a shift away from a manufacturing economy toward a service economy (*Iverson & Wren, 1998*). Many of the world’s largest corporations come from the service industry (*Wölfli, 2005*) and service jobs continue to increase in their monetary contribution to the global economy

(OECD, 2000). Recent findings examining employment across 24 different countries found that on average, 70% of employed individuals are working in the service sector (Wölf, 2005).

The service sector differs from manufacturing and agricultural industries in a number of ways, typically referred to as "IHIP characteristics" (see Moeller, 2010, for a review): the *intangibility* of services (as contrasted with the tangibility of goods); *heterogeneity*, or lack of standardization, the *inseparability* or simultaneity of production and consumption of services (as compared to separation of the production and consumption of goods), and *perishability* or the fact that services cannot be stored. Schneider and colleagues (Bowen & Schneider, 1988; Schneider, 1990; Schneider & Bowen, 1985, 1992) have talked extensively about the implications of these distinctions for managing service employees and the changed nature of many HR processes (e.g. selection, evaluation) when the goal is satisfied and loyal customers (Bove & Johnson, 2000); our focus is on how more service focused work may affect fairness perceptions and expectations.

Note that these four trends are interrelated. For example, enhanced technology has enabled globalization of many industries, changed the nature of many customer service transactions, and enabled i-deals such as telecommuting. As another example, work-force diversity contributes to the changing employee-organization relationship. Thus, while we discuss these trends separately, they are intertwined.

In the next sections, we expand on each of these trends in terms of how they may influence how justice is defined and perceived by individuals, what people expect in terms of fairness in the workplace, and how justice affects workplace outcomes.

## 2. Diversity and fairness

A desire for fair outcomes, processes, and treatment may be universal (Greenberg, 2001); however, research has shown us that individuals can vary in their fairness-related assessments of the same organization, event and/or individual depending on factors, such as affect (e.g. Barsky & Kaplan, 2007), personality (e.g. Truxillo, Bauer, Campion, & Paronto, 2006) and personal values (Schminke, Ambrose, & Noel, 1997). In organizations with diverse workforces, understanding social identity-based differences in fairness construal is important to organizational functioning and HR management, as attracting and maintaining the best talent include projecting an image that the organization values diverse individuals (Avery & McKay, 2006). In this section, we will discuss how increases in globalization and diversity may necessitate an evolution in our understanding of how distributive, procedural and interactional fairness at work are perceived and valued.

### 2.1. Distributive justice perceptions

Cultures may influence preferences for certain ways of distributing outcomes. An *equity* perspective is a common one and refers to a situation in which outcomes are justified by relative contributions (i.e. the individual who contributes the most gets the most desirable outcome); however, in other instances a fair outcome may be seen as one in which those who have the greatest need get the most desirable outcomes (*need* perspective) or one in which everyone shares equally in outcomes regardless of contribution (*equality* perspective) (Deutsch, 1985). Studies conducted in Korea (Kim, Park, & Suzuki, 1990) and India (Murphy-Berman, Berman, Singh, Pachauri, & Kumar, 1984) show greater preferences for *equality* and *need* perspectives of distributive fairness, respectively, than equity; other research has suggested that employees in countries low in individualism (i.e. *collectivist*) also value equity in allocation of rewards (Leung, 1997; Marin, 1985). It may be that social categories influence whether one views a given situation as one for which equity, need, or equality is the best means of allocation. Further, a diverse work force may lead to changing views on the appropriateness of different justice rules.

There also may be cultural and demographic differences in how equity is construed. Using the cultural value orientation framework (Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck, 1961), Bolino and Turnley (2008) describe several ways in which culture affects individuals' views of contributions and outcomes when making an equity judgment. For example, contributions (or inputs) are traditionally thought of as employee performance in U.S.-based research, however, in more *lineal* cultures, which are more accepting of differences based on status or seniority, inputs may also include one's rank in the organization. Therefore, leaders of international teams or expatriate managers may run into issues where an employee feels that they deserve an outcome based on status rather than performance, or vice versa. On the outcome side of the equity judgment process, cultures in which individuals value "living for the moment" (*being* cultures) and/or focus on their in-groups instead of on themselves (*collateral* cultures) may place less value on material outcomes (e.g. pay, benefits) and more on social-*relational* outcomes (e.g. positive work culture and interpersonal interactions). This presents another future challenge to globalizing organizations, as one culture's just outcome may be another culture's unjust outcome.

The effects of diversity on distributive justice can also be thought about in terms of some of the fundamental concepts in the justice literature, *self-interest* and *social comparison* (i.e., that individuals compare their treatment and outcomes to others when deciding whether or not something is fair; Adams, 1963). An individual who identifies with a particular social identity (e.g. woman, gay, Black, Muslim) may not only be motivated by self-interest, but also by the interests of their social identity group (i.e. *collective welfare*, Brewer & Gardner, 1996), particularly when they are part of a minority and marginalized group (Azzi, 1992). Further, when making social comparisons of treatment or outcomes, individuals with a strong group identity may not only compare personal outcomes/treatment to others' outcomes/treatment, but also make intergroup comparisons (Brickson, 2000). For example, a woman may form fairness perceptions based on the treatment of female employees compared to male employees and react negatively to discrepancies (Glomb et al., 1997). Thus, a process that is perceived as unfair for a particular subgroup of individuals will likely cause individuals within that subgroup to view those systems as unfair, even when they are not *personally* affected by negative outcomes associated

with said system. It is important for organizations to be aware of how their “diversity reputation” is reflected to potential and current employees (Avery & McKay, 2006), in addition to the treatment of diverse individuals on a one-to-one basis.

It is also important to note that it is not only those in minorities or marginalized groups who care about diversity-related fairness issues. Recent research in the United States has shown that members of the majority (typically White males) report negative organizational-related outcomes, such as lower organizational commitment and job satisfaction, when the climate is viewed as discriminatory or unfair toward a minority group (e.g. McKay et al., 2007; Wessel & Ryan, 2012). While research does clearly suggest more negative fairness perceptions for preference-based forms of affirmative action (Kravitz, 2008), those views are confined to actions based on clear group preference and not to diversity in general. As norms continue to shift toward tolerance (Avery et al., 2007; Bobo et al., in press; Brewster & Padavic, 2000), diversity-friendly policies and a non-discriminatory organizational culture may play more and more of a role in organizational fairness perceptions for all employees.

### 2.2. Procedural justice perceptions

Research on procedural justice has found little evidence of cultural influences and more indications of universality. In terms of selection systems, in an international sample of 21 countries, Ryan et al. (2009) found that individuals with differing cultural values (e.g. independent vs. interdependent) perceived the procedural fairness of different selection tools very similarly. This study and others (e.g. Anderson & Witvliet, 2008; Steiner & Gilliland, 1996) suggest a universal standard of fair selection processes in which objective and job-related measures (e.g. work-sample tests, interviews) are seen as the most fair. In terms of other HR systems, there are some indications of cultural differences in voice expectations in evaluative contexts (Brockner et al., 2001; Fodchuk & Sherman, 2008; Tata, 2005), suggesting that one culture's fair level of participation and input may be viewed as insufficient by another. Related, even universal endorsement of the principle of consistency may mean different things in practice; for example, standardization of an HR practice (performance appraisal) can be seen as unfair in locations that value self-expression and see consistency as a restricting voice (Lunnan & Traavik, 2009). Thus, a key concern for HR practices will be recognizing that what is considered “sufficient voice” and “consistent” may not be universal, and may be influenced by cultural and demographic differences.

### 2.3. Interactional justice

Norms for interpersonal fairness (i.e. how one is treated by authorities) can vary across social groups. Although it seems intuitive that all cultures, genders, ethnicities and religions value being treated politely and with respect (Meier, 1995), different groups may define those aspects of interpersonal justice differently. For example, individuals from more talkative cultures may view individuals from less talkative cultures as uncooperative during communications (Tannen, 1983) and women tend to engage in longer conversations than men (Friebel & Seabright, 2011), potentially leading them to see a person in authority as disrespectful or impolite if he or she engages only in a short conversation when discussing a decision. As another example, cultures can vary in degree of directness in speech, with individuals from less direct countries (e.g. Japan) seeing individuals from more direct countries (e.g. United States) as pushy and rude (Meier, 1995; Tannen, 1983). Leung and Tong (2004) emphasize several important cross-cultural differences that could lead to misperceptions of impolite treatment, including the value put on maintaining face (i.e. avoiding embarrassment), desire for privacy, and norms for interacting with subordinates. Further, social categories may relate to sensitivity to different types of interpersonal injustice. As one example of this, when asked to list daily examples of impoliteness, Chinese and German individuals were the most likely to list incidents in which an individual insulted them relationally (e.g. made them feel their relationship was not important) whereas English and Turkish individuals were more likely to list incidents in which an individual insulted them personally (e.g. told them something negative about themselves; Culpeper, Marti, Mei, Nevala, & Schauer, 2010). Together, these examples highlight differences in perceptions of interactional justice in personnel decision contexts that may be encountered as the workforce becomes increasingly diverse.

### 2.4. Justice expectations

Besides changes in perceptions of what is fair, shifting demographics can signal changes in expectations employees have of HR systems. The increase in non-discrimination employment legislation around the globe (e.g. ADA, 1990; Employment Equality Directive, 2000; PEPUDA, 2000; SDQ, 1995) suggests expectation change concerning subgroup treatment is an international trend. Providing benefits for specific needs of certain minority individuals (e.g. same-sex partner benefits; Human Rights Campaign, 2006) and emphasizing organizational diversity as an important part of a recruitment strategy (Shin & Gulati, 2011) are responses to changed expectations regarding treatment of minorities. In order to be perceived as a fair and just place to work, organizations can benefit from being at the forefront of pro-diversity policies by considering emerging issues of diversity and fairness. As two examples, societal trends such as an aging workforce (BLS, 2008) and an increasing number of individuals categorized as overweight or obese (OECD, 2010) bring with them potential workplace fairness issues regarding age and obesity discrimination that will likely affect expectations of fairness in the future.

### 2.5. Links to outcomes

Finally, there may be changes in how various fairness perceptions coalesce and relate to outcomes associated with globalization and diversification. Relative weights of distributive versus interactional and procedural justice appear to vary by culture and gender.

Simpson and Kaminski (2007) found that Black women gave greater weight to interactional than distributive justice and procedural justice relative to other demographic groups. There is some evidence that relations of fairness perceptions to outcomes (satisfaction, turnover intentions, affective commitment) vary across cultures (Kim & Leung, 2007) and between men and women (Jepsen & Rodwell, 2009; Sweeney & McFarlin, 1997). Thus, HR practices seen as fair in to members of one group may matter more (or less) for other groups of people. Note, however, that cultural findings are quite mixed as some research has not found culture to moderate procedural justice and interactional justice links to outcomes (Lam, Schaubroeck, & Aryee, 2002; Morris & Leung, 2000) and others have (both Brockner et al., 2001; Tyler, Lind, & Huo, 2000) found voice effects to be moderated by culture. In a meta-analysis, Li and Cropanzano (2009) found that the effects of justice on outcome variables are stronger in North America than in East Asia. As Morris and Leung (2000) concluded, justice matters universally in that unfairness leads to more negative outcomes everywhere, but culture influences the mix of factors considered in deriving overall fairness perceptions as well as moderates the strength of their effects. Research on gender as a moderator for the justice-outcomes relationship are mixed as well, with some research finding that gender moderates the relationship between specific types of fairness and certain outcomes (Brockner & Adsit, 1986; Jepsen & Rodwell, 2009; Sweeney & McFarlin, 1997) and others research finding highly similar relationships between fairness perceptions and work-related outcomes (Lee & Farh, 1999; Witt & Nye, 1992). Overall, the role of gender as a moderator is complex and may not be adequately understood in the current state of the literature.

### 2.6. Summary

The globalizing and diversifying workforce has the potential to impact management strategies directed toward creating or maintaining a workplace that is perceived as fair. Table 1 summarizes the impacts we have highlighted here, while Table 2 acknowledges their practical implications. Different cultures and social identity groups can influence the way in which outcomes, policies, and interactions are perceived, both in terms of fairness perception formation processes and fairness expectations. Failure to recognize the importance of this shift and the need for awareness in all organizational systems of cultural- and identity-based differences have the potential to leave organizations behind in their future fight for talent.

## 3. Technology-mediated relationships and fairness

Greater use of technology in the workplace has led to a) evolving definitions of what are fair employment practices in relation to that use, b) evolving standards regarding the fairness of decisions communicated via technology and c) changing relationships between the characteristics of those decisions and HR actions and outcomes when technology is involved. We discuss each of these in turn.

### 3.1. Changing perceptions of fair use of technology

Much has been written regarding fairness issues surrounding electronic use policies, which provide employees with information as to what email, Internet, and other technology use is appropriate or unacceptable to the organization as well as to consequences of

misuse (Aiello & Kolb, 1995). Henle, Kohut, and Booth (2009) summarize this literature and note that employee perceptions of fairness may be affected by four components – consent, monitoring, discipline, and grievance procedures. However, they also note that consent and monitoring have little effect on fairness perceptions relative to the other two because employees recognize that they typically must consent to policies and monitoring as a condition of employment. Henle et al. conclude that policies with progressive discipline or zero tolerance may both be viewed as fair as long as managerial discretion is minimized and there is an appeal process.

As technology further infiltrates daily activities, however, interesting questions beyond the basic fairness of technology use policies arise. For example, employees may expect a certain level of “cyberloafing” or use of technology for personal business (e.g., non-work related emails, online shopping and bill paying, social media interactions) as a reasonable means of maintaining work-life balance or taking a break from work-related tasks (Henle et al., 2009). Fairness issues arise, though, as employee and employer definitions of what is interfering with work or of what is considered harmful for the organization differ (e.g., posts on social media that are personal but reflect negatively on the organization). For example, collecting information that is not related to job performance is likely to be seen as an invasion of privacy and unfair (Ambrose & Adler, 2000); however, such collection may be inadvertent or necessary while monitoring performance (i.e., all emails sent and websites browsed need to be tracked). People may view greater violations of procedural justice when there is greater potential to gather non-work-related information (McNall & Roch, 2007).

A specific set of questions regarding monitoring technology use in the workplace has to do with privacy (e.g., Alge, 2001; Alge, Ballinger, Tangirala, & Oakley, 2006). Eddy, Stone, and Stone-Romero (1999) describe two conditions for the protection of privacy: the information must be voluntarily released by the person who generated it and the person who receives it must not reveal it to external third parties. In general, the increased use of technology in the workplace raises questions about the voluntary nature (and in many cases awareness) of information tracking by employers as well as whether adequate protections are in place to safeguard against release of information to others. Schwartz, Chadwick, and Lucas (2010) note that it is critical that employers convey that even if personal use of employer-owned technology (e.g., cell phone, pager, email account) is allowed, employees should not have expectations of privacy.

In sum, while there is general agreement on principles of what is fair use of technology and fair monitoring (i.e., consent, privacy protection), there is a continual evolution in terms of what constitutes fair operationalization of those principles (e.g., acceptable levels of non-job related use). Also, Swanson (2001) found that the majority of employees did not know what their organization’s monitoring policies were, suggesting the possibility of negative informational justice perceptions.

### 3.2. Fairness perceptions of technology-mediated communications

Virtual communication is certainly seen as cost-effective and efficient, and therefore may often be preferred to face-to-face communication. An interesting set of questions arises as to how virtual communications of information are viewed relative to the same information communicated in person. There are a number of reasons why fairness perceptions of the two might differ, related to how technology might affect the information one has to make distributive, procedural, informational and interpersonal justice judgments.

First, technology may allow for different information with which to make distributive justice judgments. Media vary in richness, such that richer media transmit more nonverbal and verbal cues, use natural language, allow for immediate feedback, and enable conveying emotions (Daft & Lengel, 1986). Technology-mediated communications certainly vary in richness and some are less rich than face-to-face, potentially providing less information with which to arrive at conclusions about the fairness of decisions. For example, with regard to distributive justice, in a virtual workplace, if you do not see how coworkers are treated, you cannot make equity judgments in the same way as you would if you could witness treatment. On the other hand, employees may be able to access greater quantities of comparative information as shared information across cyberspace can allow an employee to more quickly learn if his pay raise is substandard for his industry or for a job applicant to learn what kinds of salary offers individuals with his number of years of experience are getting. Access to advanced technology itself might also be an outcome that affects fairness perceptions (e.g., who gets newer software or hardware, who receives technical training).

Second, technology may influence procedural justice judgments in that it can influence consistency and opportunity to perform (Alge, 2001; McNall & Roch, 2007). On the positive side, technology can increase fairness perceptions when processes are digitally administered, evaluations are automated, and individuals can verify information, as the possibility of human bias and error is removed. Conversely, unfairness perceptions might arise if there are questions about technology accessibility and compatibility across applicant subgroups (i.e., a digital divide, or gap in technology ownership and access between affluent and poor, Ford & Whaley, 2003; Jones & Dages, 2003).

Technology can detract from perceptions of control and hence procedural fairness, for example, when applicants cannot provide tailored resume information but must complete a standardized application form or when individuals feel they have no opportunity to rebut negative reputational information found on the internet by potential employers (Zickar & Lake, 2011). Negative effects on procedural justice perceptions also can occur with less familiar technologies. For example, computer-adaptive testing (CAT) varies item selection and test length based on examinee answers, so that individuals are not given the same assessment (Tonidandel & Quiñones, 2000). The greater perceived difficulty of CATs, inconsistency across individuals, and the challenges in explaining underlying algorithms to respondents often lead to questions regarding their fairness (McCloy & Gibby, 2011). As another example, unproctored internet testing (UIT) is liked because of the greater flexibility it provides job applicants in taking hiring assessments in places and at times they prefer. However, individuals may feel that UIT provides less consistency and lesser opportunities to perform well because of lack of control, cheating, and variability in quality of Internet access (Bauer, Truxillo, Mack, & Costa, 2011; Burke, 2009).

Third, technology may affect informational justice in that it leads individuals to communicate decisions in briefer terms and more rapidly (Cramton, 2002). Receiving information about procedures (e.g., the steps in a hiring process, time till offer) and decisions of interest (e.g., who got promoted, what one's next work assignment is) more quickly should be viewed positively (Bauer et al., 2001); however, less explanation for the decision may be viewed more negatively. Informational justice research has also established that sincerity is a key influence on whether explanations are judged as adequate (Bies, Shapiro, & Cummings, 1988). Technology mediated communication may make sincerity harder to judge, absent non-verbal cues that might be relied on in other contexts, as research on trust formation in electronic service delivery has indicated (Beldad, de Jong, & Steehouder, 2010).

Technology might influence perceptions of informational justice in that decision making principles and explanations more often are in a permanent record (Hakonen & Lipponen, 2008). Questions regarding what was said or done in regard to a personnel decision can be resolved via examining an electronic trail. Note however, that while some forms of electronic communication leave a trail (email) others (some IM systems) do not (Cameron & Webster, 2005), perhaps resulting in more disputes over what occurred and why. Managers should be made aware that critical communications (e.g., assignments, personnel decisions) should be conveyed through traceable formats (Cameron & Webster, 2005). Conversely, stored data can lead to security and privacy concerns (Bauer et al., 2011; Jones & Dages, 2003).

Finally, technology-mediated communications can be misunderstood because of their brevity and the lack of non-verba and that can affect interpersonal justice perceptions. For example, a simple yes or no answer to a question might be seen as rude and abrupt when conveyed virtually in response to a long email request, but might be fine if in a face-to-face context one saw a manager was very busy. Cameron and Webster (2005) noted that instant messaging communications (e.g., texting) “may suggest a light and informal tone, non-authoritative conversation, and the breaking down of hierarchical barriers” (p. 91); whether that inadvertently affects interpersonal justice perceptions is open to debate. Mackenzie (2010) found that employees generally felt that face-to-face contact is the best way to interact at work and that digital communication methods detract from relationships, even though there is general consensus as to their value in terms of efficiency and productivity. She also noted that while managers recognize the need to do more in relationship building to offset this challenge of digital communication, it is not clear that they are.

Other research relevant to interpersonal justice has examined how technology use in certain contexts may be considered rude. *Multicommmunicating*, or managing multiple conversations at once such as texting while at a meeting, or *electronic multitasking*, such as using wireless email devices or laptops while participating in a meeting, can result in a spiral of incivility (Cameron & Webster, 2011) as individuals feel they are ignored by the other party. As Cameron and Webster (2011) note, technology in this case can help an individual juggle multiple conversations and perhaps increase their accessibility, but can backfire if others feel the individual

who is the authoritative decision-maker is inattentive. Of particular interest is that their research shows that individuals are more upset if the multicommunicator is of higher status (i.e., one's manager is not paying attention rather than one's subordinate). Organizational norms play an important role in interpreting whether multicomunicating and electronic multitasking during a face-to-face meeting are considered rude (Stephens & Davis, 2009).

Some attention has specifically been paid to the role of technology in interpersonal fairness perceptions of hiring processes. A comparison of face-to-face screenings with telephone interviews and interactive voice response (IVR) screenings found that IVR screenings were rated lower in interpersonal justice aspects such as interpersonal treatment, but this did not seem to affect perceptions of organizational attractiveness or job pursuit (Bauer, Truxillo, Paronto, Weekley, & Campion, 2004). Face-to-face interviews are perceived as more fair and lead to greater job acceptance intentions than telephone or videoconferenced interviews (Chapman, Uggerslev, & Webster, 2003). While technology that reduces or eliminates human interaction may initially be detrimental to interpersonal treatment perceptions (Bauer et al., 2011), as technology uses in hiring and other HR decision-making settings become more prevalent, individual comfort with their lack of “warmth” may diminish.

### 3.3. Relationship of technology-mediated decisions to outcomes

Justice researchers have accumulated a wealth of knowledge regarding how perceptions of the fairness of actions relate to outcomes (Colquitt et al., 2001). One question is whether technology-mediated actions that are perceived as fair or unfair might relate to outcomes differently than when technology is not a part of the mix. For virtual teams with greater geographical dispersion and less face-to-face meetings, a stronger relationship between procedural justice and identification with the team was evident than in cases with greater face-to-face interaction (Hakonen & Lipponen, 2008). Hakonen and Lipponen note that this follows from the uncertainty management model of procedural justice (van den Bos & Lind, 2001) in that people are more sensitive to fairness when there are highly uncertain conditions, and greater virtuality in relationships leads to greater uncertainty and hence stronger reactions to injustice.

One way in which technology might affect the links of fairness to outcomes is that it may enable organizations to move quickly, directly, and consistently respond to justice violations (e.g., mass email apologies). While a quicker response is not necessarily a better one, “getting ahead of reactions” can help squash a growing negative problem. Just as individuals now can quickly mobilize for collective action against an organization (e.g., consumer protests against fee hikes) so too can organizations quickly respond to mitigate unfairness perceptions.

### 3.4. Summary

There are apparent implications for the use of technology-mediated communication and decision-making mechanisms in organizations that derive directly from organizational justice theory around how to enhance distributive, procedural, informational and interpersonal justice: make sure information collected is job relevant (Ambrose & Adler, 2000), allow participation into the design and implementation of new systems (Thibaut & Walker, 1975), and make sure systems are used consistently (Van den Bos, Vermunt, & Wilke, 1996). These suggestions derive directly from prior work on organizational justice and would not be news to the astute HR practitioner. However, “In the age of ever-changing technology and ubiquitous computing, new workplace interactions have emerged for which the preexisting rules, norms, and rituals are inadequate.” (Cameron & Webster, 2011, p. 766). One might ask if the next generation of workers entering the workforce, having grown up with digital communication and technology-mediated relationships, might not have the same reactions to technology relative to many of today’s workers. However, Myers and Sadaghiani (2010) point out that while Millennials (born between 1979 and 1994) like computer mediated communication, they also desire high levels of supportive supervision and structure, which may be less likely to occur in more virtual relationships. Table 1 provides a summary of the potential effects of technology-mediated communication and processes noted here and Table 2 suggests potential practical implications.

## 4. Individualization and flexibility in employment relationships and fairness

Investigation of fairness in the employee-organization relationship (EOR) has focused on breach and violations of psychological contracts. A breach is falling short in fulfilling one's obligations, while a violation is a willful failure to honor commitments (Rousseau, 2011). Perceptions of breach or violation stem from differences between employers and employees regarding what the employment relationship should be like, as well as miscommunication and lack of clarity about expectations (Morrison & Robinson, 2008). A meta-analysis found breach or violation of the psychological contract has negative consequences such as lower job satisfaction, commitment, OCB, performance and higher turnover (Zhao, Wayne, Glibowski, & Bravo, 2007). Minor deviations from expectation may be tolerated, especially when good explanations are provided (Shore et al., 2004). The question to address is whether increasing variations in psychological contracts across employees (i-deals) as well as changing expectations of the EOR move outside these zones of tolerance to be considered breaches or violations (i.e., unfair).

Increasing flexibility in work arrangements can challenge or enhance two fundamental notions associated with distributive and procedural justice perceptions: equity in outcomes and consistency in procedures. As noted earlier, individuals make distributive justice judgments regarding whether the outcomes received are fair, often based on social comparisons. If others have different deals from one's own, perhaps based on something other than “traditional” inputs, individuals may see it as unfair. For example, if one person can telecommute or work part-time, why can't others? If one negotiates a late start time on Tuesdays, why can't everyone?

The presence of i-deals can motivate social comparisons in a workgroup, as the variety in outcomes individuals receive can lead to perceptions of inequity (Ho, 2005). Also, people attend more to injustice than to justice as they attend more to negative information (Gilliland, 2008) and there is a self-serving bias in justice evaluations (Gillespie & Greenberg, 2005). I-deals may draw increased attention to inputs and outcomes and lead individuals to make greater comparisons (and, as we noted earlier in discussing technology, individuals may have more information about referent others in other organizations and locations with which to compare their “deal”). Indeed, research has indicated that the greater prevalence of task and schedule i-deals for part time workers may be predicated on the fact that part-time jobs are less comparable, making it easier to sidestep issues of justice among coworkers (Hornung et al., 2010).

Similarly, individualization and flexibility naturally means inconsistency in how employees are treated. While the positive side of a flexible workplace is accommodation and recognition of individual needs, the negative side is that inconsistency tends to lead to perceptions of procedural unfairness (Thibaut & Walker, 1975). Further, there may be some concerns about informational justice in that i-deals are often not put forth for public discussion and scrutiny. A manager who wishes to allow an employee a more flexible work schedule to take her mother for chemotherapy treatments for 5 weeks may not see a need to justify or explain it to other employees; however, informational justice research would suggest that the absence of any information as to how the decision was made or why can lead to unfairness perceptions. Coworker reactions are particularly likely to be affected by the availability of information regarding others' i-deals (Lai, Rousseau, & Chang, 2009). While in some cases i-deals may be visible and appear normative (i.e., many people have different schedules), in other cases they may not be public and thus may seem irregular when they become known by others (e.g., a coworker has been promised the ability to take 4 weeks of vacation at once).

I-deals may often enhance perceptions of interpersonal justice as individual needs and preferences are respected. However, attempts to negotiate i-deals can have negative effects on perceptions and fair treatment outcomes when requests are denied (Hornung et al., 2010). In an investigation of coworker perceptions of the fairness of others' i-deals, Lai et al. (2009) posited that acceptance of those i-deals is predicated on the degree to which coworkers endorse the basis for the decision (e.g., based on merit and see person as meritorious), perceptions of the right of the employer to make such a deal, the instrumentality for the coworker (e.g., increasing work burden, signaling potential for future deals of one's own), the relationship with the recipient of the deal, and the nature of the individual's own relationship with their employer. Further, they suggest that because i-deals differ both in content and in timing (e.g., negotiated when recruited versus later) both might affect perceptions of their fairness. Coworkers might facilitate an i-deal by being willing to tolerate differential treatment; in the same vein, coworkers might also sabotage the effectiveness of an i-deal by non tolerance (e.g., intentionally not updating a coworker who keeps a non-standard schedule, thereby creating problems for work performance; Anand, Vidyarthi, Liden, & Rousseau, 2010).

### 4.1. Summary

Individualization and flexibility in the EOR may enhance fairness perceptions for many by increasing feelings of distributive justice and respect for individuals, but may decrease perceptions of consistency (procedural justice), informational justice, and equity from the point of view of coworkers. The need for careful implementation of i-deals is apparent. Table 1 provides a summary of the potential effects of individualization on fairness; Table 2 considers the potential practical implications of this trend.

## 5. The growing service sector and fairness

The continuing shift toward the service industry and positions involving some degree of customer contact highlight several issues related to fairness at work. In the following section, we will discuss the potential influence of the rise of the service industry on fairness-related HR challenges in three areas: 1) employee attitudes and outcomes as related to customer interpersonal justice, 2) employee fairness perceptions of the organization and customer-related outcomes, and 3) service-sector assessment and fairness perceptions.

### 5.1. Customer interpersonal injustice related to employee outcomes

As stated earlier, interpersonal justice refers to the extent to which someone is treated politely and respectfully by an authority in a decision context (Bies & Moag, 1986). Studies have only recently focused on customers as a source of justice or injustice (e.g. Grandey, Dickler, & Sin, 2004; Rupp & Spencer, 2006; Skarlicki, van Jaarsveld, & Walker, 2008); in these cases the term interactional justice is used more broadly in reference to workplace interactions and not to fairness in context of a specific decision by an authority figure. Not all interactions between service providers (i.e. employees in service positions) and their customers go smoothly and encounters with rude or even hostile customers can be commonplace in certain settings (Grandey et al., 2004). Experiencing negative interactions with customers can become a problem for the organization, as these types of encounters have been linked directly and indirectly to reports of greater stress and emotional exhaustion (Grandey et al., 2004; Karatepe, Yorganci, & Haktanir, 2009), lower job satisfaction (Holmvall & Sidhu, 2007), higher withdrawal behaviors/intentions (Grandey et al., 2004; Karatepe et al., 2009), and less positive behaviors toward customers (Skarlicki et al., 2008). As one example, frontline hotel employees experiencing customer aggression reported feeling greater emotional exhaustion, which directly related to decreased job satisfaction and increased turnover intentions (Karatepe et al., 2009). As another example, some call-center workers coped with being mistreated by customers through engaging in sabotage behaviors, such as intentionally keeping the customer on hold or hanging up on a customer (Skarlicki et al., 2008).

Further, the “customer is always right” mentality, which puts the customer’s needs first regardless of their conduct, pervades many service contexts (Boyd, 2002) and can exacerbate the negative outcomes of experiencing interpersonal mistreatment from an

impolite or hostile customer. Many organizations in the service industry have informal or formal display rules, or norms for emotions and behaviors that should be displayed toward customers, regardless of actual felt emotions (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987; Spencer & Rupp, 2009). When interacting with a rude customer, service providers may feel that they have to fake positive emotions through surface acting (e.g., smiling, talking in an upbeat way; Beal, Trougakos, Weiss, & Green, 2006; Hochschild, 1983). This type of emotional labor (Grandey, Fisk, & Steiner, 2005; Wharton & Erickson, 1993) when enduring unfair treatment can lead to negative outcomes for service providers and their organizations, including lower job satisfaction (Grandey, 2003) and increased emotional exhaustion (Goldberg & Grandey, 2007).

Given the negative direct and indirect (through emotional labor) outcomes of interactions with rude customers, it may be advantageous for organizations to design mechanisms for reducing stress through positive outlets after experiencing interpersonal mistreatment from customers. Also, having proactive policies for how to deal with these types of customers (and potentially prevent escalation) would be helpful for not only the service provider and his/her coping, but also in reducing costs for the organizations associated with disengaged employees and upset customers (Boyd, 2002).

### 5.2. Justice perceptions related to customer-oriented behaviors

Masterson (2001) proposed a *trickle-down model* of fairness to explain connections between the perceived fairness of the organization, the employee, and the customer. Specifically, the model predicts that employee perceptions of the organization's distributive and procedural justice will affect that employee's commitment to the organization, which will affect how fairly they treat the customers, in terms of effort and pro-social behaviors. In turn, customers who perceive fair treatment will treat react positively toward the employee. This model was supported in a sample of university instructors (service providers) and students (customers). Other studies have found similar findings. In a study of bank tellers, fairness perceptions related to pay, promotion rules, supervisor supervision, and administration of rules were all related to engagement in helpful behaviors toward customers (as rated by their managers; Bettencourt & Brown, 1997). Also, fast-food and restaurant workers who felt their supervisor had not fulfilled obligations to them (arguably related to distributive justice) displayed less positive behaviors toward customers, leading to reports of lower customer satisfaction (Bordia, Restubog, Bordia, & Tang, 2010). These studies emphasize the importance of organizational fairness in the service sector, as it has the potential to not only impact the employee's outcomes, but the treatment and satisfaction of customers.

### 5.3. Fairness perceptions of customer evaluations

Performance appraisal research has suggested that the appearance of fair procedures goes a long way with employees, in terms of their satisfaction with the process (see Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001 for a meta-analysis), satisfaction with the organization and supervisors (Poon, 2004; Taylor, Tracy, Renard, Harrison, & Carroll, 1995), and turnover intentions (Poon, 2004). Performance evaluations in service positions often have customer-based input, such as using customer satisfaction as part of the appraisal system, in order to orient employees toward the needs of the customer and increase long-term profits (Hauser, Simester, & Wernerfelt, 1994; Lambert, Sharma, & Levy, 1997; Widmier, 2002). However, customer input into evaluations may be seen as violating procedural justice. Employees may feel that customer evaluations are biased and that, in some cases, negative customer encounters are more the fault of the customer than the service provider (Bitner, Booms, & Mohr, 1994). In the restaurant industry, other characteristics besides performance may come into patrons' evaluations of wait staff. For example, the ethnicity and gender of the server played a role in how positively they are evaluated (Juni, Brannon, & Roth, 1988; Lynn et al., 2008; Lynn & Sturman, 2011) as does the quality and price of the food, factors unrelated to the server's behavior and therefore leading to seeing customer evaluations as unfair.

### 5.4. Summary

As positions involving customer interaction increase, so does the need to examine fairness issues unique to the service context. In this section, we have outlined several ways in which negative perceptions of fairness could impact service organizations and their goals of creating and maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty and these are summarized in Table 1. For HR managers in service contexts, efforts to proactively and reactively address employee experiences with impolite customers, avoid an unfair climate that may trickle down in its effects to the customers, and balance the performance goals of the organization with the reactions of the employees to certain performance appraisal systems will be the major challenges as this trend of service sector growth continues. Ideas for how to enact those efforts are suggested in Table 2.

### 5.5. Overarching themes

Our analysis of how four key trends in the workplace may affect fairness perceptions, fairness expectations, and the links of fairness perceptions to organizationally relevant outcomes reveal some overarching themes worth noting.

In a number of places, we have documented that the changes in the workplace may lead to changes in social comparison processes – changing to whom we compare (e.g., our social group to other social groups), on what information we base comparisons (e.g., technology providing access to more information), and the types of comparisons we make (e.g., i-deals opening up new bases for comparing ourselves to coworkers). HR practitioners are used to ensuring that individuals have accurate information on which to make comparisons and to adjust expectations (e.g., with pay scales); these trends mean that even greater attention may need to be paid to whether individuals are making appropriate social comparisons and with accurate information.

A second theme is the paradox of increased expectations of consistency accompanied by increased expectations of inconsistency. That is, with the increases in technology creating uniformity in HR processes and increases in equal opportunity laws globally, people expect to be treated the same as others in personnel decision making. At the same time, recognition of diversity and desires for i-deals speak to expectations of recognizing individual differences in needs and wants, thus treating people differently (or inconsistently). The challenge will be for HR systems and individual managerial decisions to be seen as procedurally fair by being consistent in ways desired and inconsistent in ways desired. Dilemmas may arise when those clash (i.e., a policy of no exceptions when someone wants an exception; an i-deal that makes coworkers cry foul).

One final overarching point we wish to share is that increasing interconnectedness through forces such as technological change and globalization may create greater potential for the “trickle-down” fairness processes mentioned by Bordia et al. (2010) to emerge. Their model showed a “fairness chain” whereby how a supervisor was treated by the organization affected how he/she treated employees which affected how they treated customers. In many ways, increased interconnectedness of individuals within and between organizations is creating a “fairness web” where how one individual is treated in one relationship may affect their treatment of others. Evidence of this at the interpersonal justice level can be drawn from research on incivility spirals (Andersson & Pearson, 1999) that show rudeness and mistreatment can escalate. We believe that the reverse can also occur in fairness webs where organizations that treat employees fairly create a force that leads to fair treatment of others in outside contexts (e.g., customers, global and virtual partners), to new norm setting in industries regarding fair treatment, and perhaps even leading to social policy change that creates fairer workplaces for all.
