## ABSTRACT

As artificial intelligence (AI) became a part of daily life, it has become important to determine user competence in using AI technology. Here, we propose the concept of AI literacy and develop a quantitative scale for obtaining accurate data regarding the AI literacy of ordinary users. We first identified the primary core constructs of AI literacy, including awareness, use, evaluation, and ethics. Next, we generated 65 items to capture these four constructs; only 31 items were retained after a three-step content validation process. Then, we conducted a survey, and collected two samples of data. By reducing the number of items using the first sample and performing reliability and validity tests on the second sample, we obtained a 12-item instrument for the quantitative measurement of AI literacy. The results confirmed that the proposed four-construct model is an adequate representation of AI literacy. Further, AI literacy is significantly related to digital literacy, attitude towards robots, and users' daily usage of AI. This study will not only aid researchers in understanding how user competence in using AI technology affects human–AI interactions but will also help designers develop AI applications that are aligned with the AI literacy levels of the target users.

## 1. Introduction

Our lives have changed significantly with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. With an increasing number of smart devices and AI-embedded applications becoming available, we are witnessing an era where ordinary users are transforming from AI immigrants into AI natives. The competence required to survive and engage in the so-called 'AI era' (Davenport and Ronanki 2018) is increasingly becoming a necessary skill. Several researchers have suggested that there is an urgent need to improve people's ability to use AI in the coming era (Kandlhofer et al. 2016; Su 2018; Tarafdar, Beath, and Ross 2019). At the same time, others (Jarrahi 2018; Stembert and Harbers 2019) have highlighted the positive effects of high AI competence on human–AI interactions (HAI). Although Long and Magerko (2020) has summarised a set of core competencies in using AI technology, there neither exists a mature framework nor a practical tool for measuring it. To fill this gap, we propose the concept of AI literacy to describe the competence of individuals in using AI technology. AI literacy refers to the ability to properly identify, use, and evaluate AI-related products under the premise of ethical standards. Like many other related literacies, such as computer literacy (Hoffman and Blake 2003; Tobin 1983) and digital literacy (Al-

Mutka 2011; Calvani et al. 2008), AI literacy does not require people to become experts in the underlying theory of and developments related to AI. Instead, a person would be viewed as being AI literate if they are capable of using AI products proficiently and reasonably.

Research on AI literacy is crucial for three main reasons. To begin with, AI literacy will shed light on the ongoing research in HAI, because one's literacy of a product can shape one's mental model of it (Brandt 2001; Grassian and Kaplowitz 2001; Rosling and Littlemore 2011); this is important as mental models play a vital role in interaction processes (Norman 2013). It may also explain the variations in people's behaviour when they interact with AI. Second, AI literacy can help quantify user competence in AI usage. Many previous studies on HAI (Lee and Choi 2017; Luo et al. 2019; Metelskaia et al. 2018) have examined the participants' AI competence by measuring their prior experience and usage frequency, which cannot be considered complete or accurate measurements because they do not represent the participants' full competence (Munro et al. 1997) with respect to AI usage. Although prior experience with AI may be closely related to AI literacy, the development of a scale for quantifying AI literacy will allow researchers and designers to obtain a better understanding of user competence in using AI.

Finally, AI literacy will help improve AI education by providing a comprehensive framework that can serve as an outline for curriculum design (Kandlhofer et al. 2016).

This study makes the following contributions. Firstly, we propose a theoretical framework of AI literacy consisting of four constructs. Secondly, we develop a reliable and valid self-report instrument for measuring individuals' AI literacy using two sample sets. Thirdly, we explore the relationship between individuals' AI literacy and their digital literacy, attitude towards robots and daily usage of AI products and applications. In the rest of the paper, we first review the relevant literature on AI literacy and provide a detailed definition and model for it based on an analogy with digital literacy. Then, we develop a tool to measure AI literacy, using the standard process proposed by Hinkin (1998); this process involves the following steps: item generation, content validation, questionnaire administration, item reduction, confirmatory factor analysis, and reliability and validity testing. Next, we explore the relationships between users' AI literacy and users' attitude and daily usage of AI technology. Finally, we evaluate the suitability and limitations of the proposed instrument and discuss its potential for use in future research on AI.

## 2. Literature review

The term literacy originally referred to the basic skills and knowledge associated with books and printings (McMillan 1996). However, with the rapid development of computer and digital technologies, there have been many attempts to extend the conception of literacy beyond its original meaning of reading and writing (Buckingham and Burn 2007). Thus, discussions on literacy have been extended to television literacy (Buckingham 1989), information literacy (Eisenberg, Lowe, and Spitzer 2004), digital literacy (Gilster and Glister 1997), game literacy (Buckingham and Burn 2007), and media literacy (Livingstone and Van der Graaf 2008).

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technological science for simulating, extending, and expanding human intelligence. Now, the emergence of AI technology has made the concept of AI literacy necessary for describing people's competence in using this technology. Digital technology is a science and technology associated with electronic computers, which is a general concept. AI technology is a branch of computer science concentrating on the essence of intelligence. It attempts to produce a new intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. On a technical level, AI technology based on digital technology. At

the conceptual level, AI has a wide integration with the concepts of cognitive neuroscience and other disciplines. AI development involves many moral and ethical issues.

Nevertheless, for a user to be literate in a technology requires that they have more than a utilitarian perspective of it (Kandlhofer et al. 2016; Moore 2011). Thus, it is essential to understand the entire interaction process and establish the proper attitude and values towards AI systems. In this section, we discuss the existing definition and constructs of AI literacy based on existing research on the topic.

AI literacy is not a novel concept, and several researchers (Druga et al. 2019; Kandlhofer et al. 2016; Xiao and Bie 2019) have previously discussed methods for integrating AI education into existing educational frameworks. Kandlhofer et al. (2016) identified seven topics in AI literacy: automata, intelligent agents, graphs and data structures, sorting, problem solving through search, classic planning, and machine learning. However, these frameworks are only applicable with respect to the cultivation of AI literacy in students within the education system. For the general population, methods for measuring user knowledge of AI and the ability to use it remain to be developed. To establish a concrete and comprehensive framework, we referred to the underlying concepts of an intimately related literacy, namely, digital literacy. The reason for choosing digital literacy was that there already exists a significant body of literature on it, including tested theoretical frameworks, which can aid research on AI literacy. In addition, many AI applications and products rely on computer technology and information and communication technology (ICT) (Smith and Eckroth 2017), with a large number of the AI technologies available being integrated with digital applications. Being literate in digital products currently sometimes also implies the ability to use AI well.

However, we must mention that digital literacy is not a substitute for AI literacy in HAI research. Although AI belongs to the category of digital technology in a sense, AI is regarded as an interdisciplinary field involving computer science, information science, mathematics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other subjects (Russell and Norvig 2002). The intersection of these disciplines naturally indicates the differences between AI literacy and digital literacy. Besides, from users' perspective, AI usually has more biological and social attributes than general digital technology (Minsky 2007; Poria et al. 2017; Tao and Tan 2005). For example, when users face a robot, they often interact with it through social logic instead of the logic to interact with the machine (Bruce,

Nourbakhsh, and Simmons 2002; Vossen, Ham, and Midden 2010). Such differences in interactions reflect the difference in the mental models of users dealing with AI and digital technology. These differences would lead users to have different criteria for evaluating AI products than for evaluating digital products. AI literacy is not the same as digital literacy. It is inappropriate to directly describe AI Literacy by using digital literacy related content. For example, a high school student who has not been exposed to the concept of AI but is skilled in using electronic devices has good digital literacy but may have poor AI literacy in some aspects. Therefore, the instruments for digital literacy are not appropriate for measuring users' AI literacy, but the framework used to build digital literacy can inform the establishment of AI literacy. In the following section, we will review some important concepts in digital literacy for a clearer insight into AI literacy.

There are many overlaps between AI literacy and digital literacy. AI literacy and digital literacy share many similarities at the user level. The way people interact with computers is relatively consistent. Therefore, digital literacy can still provide us with many references. Digital literacy comprises the complex and integrated subdisciplines of skill, knowledge, ethics, and creative outputs in the digital environment (Calvani et al. 2008). Eseth (2004) has suggested that digital literacy refers not only to the ability to use digital devices and software but also to the cognitive, motor, sociological, and emotional skills required to work efficiently in a digital environment. Eseth (2004) proposed five dimensions for digital literacy: photo-visual literacy, reproduction literacy, branching literacy, informational literacy, and socioemotional literacy. Gapski (2007) has argued that digital literacy includes the following three areas of ability: interpreting information, selecting information, and articulating information. In turn, these capabilities are suggestive of technological, cognitive, and ethical proficiencies, which, according to Calvani, Fini, and Ranieri (2009), are the three primary aspects of digital literacy. Ferrari (2012) believes that digital literacy lies at the intersection of Internet literacy, information communication technology literacy, media literacy, and information literacy. Wilson, Scalise, and Gochyev (2015) proposed an ICT framework called KSAVE, which is an acronym for knowledge (K), skills (S), attitudes (A), values (V), and ethics (E). In KSAVE, knowledge refers to the specific requirements for understanding, such as declarative knowledge and facts; skills are the abilities and processes required to employ and deploy this knowledge. Further, attitudes, values, and ethics together constitute the behaviours and affective aspects that a person exhibits with respect to knowledge

and skills. Given these definitions, KSAVE can be viewed as a general framework that can also be applied to AI literacy. In fact, considering the close relationship between digital technology and AI technology, the above-described models lay the foundation for AI literacy.

The meaning of digital literacy has been extended significantly in the past decades, as various user devices have become ubiquitous (Hoffman and Blake 2003). The concepts of literacy must be further integrated with this new technology and must also include the broader use and social importance of computer technology. Nowadays, AI is also experiencing a similar boom, and its connotations and applications are expanding constantly. Therefore, it is difficult to summarise the specific skills that an AI-literate person should have. In other words, AI literacy 'should not be thought of as an isolated set of skills but as an essential strategy for most learning objects' (Moore 2011). In light of this idea, the technological-cognitive-ethical model and KSAVE model are more appropriate for AI literacy because they are general frameworks and do not involve specific digital skills. Based on these models, we define AI literacy as the ability to be aware of and comprehend AI technology in practical applications; to be able to apply and exploit AI technology for accomplishing tasks proficiently; and to be able to analyze, select, and critically evaluate the data and information provided by AI, while fostering awareness of one's own personal responsibilities and respect for reciprocal rights and obligations. As per this definition, the following four constructs can be identified for AI literacy: awareness, usage, evaluation, and ethics. In addition, many literacies have suggested close relationships between users' digital literacy and their attitude towards digital technology (Comunello et al. 2015; Eseth 2004; Prior et al. 2016) and their behaviours when using digital technology (Neves, Amaro, and Fonseca 2013; Noh 2017; Park 2013). Thus, we can reasonably hypothesise that AI literacy will also be positively related to their attitude towards AI and daily usage of AI applications and products.

H1a: Users' AI literacy will be positively correlated with their digital literacy.

H1b: Users' AI literacy will be positively correlated with their attitude towards AI.

H1c: Users' AI literacy will be positively correlated with their daily usage of AI applications and products.

**Awareness** refers to the ability to identify and comprehend AI technology during the use of AI-related applications. Many researchers (Calvani, Fini, and Ranieri

![](a0167e3dcece9dcd8a378bcd98fb9cfa_img.jpg)

2009; Hallaq 2016; Katz 2007; Martin and Grudziecki 2006) have introduced awareness as a cognitive process that occurs before one uses a particular technology. Hallaq (2016) introduced awareness as one of the five core constructs of media literacy. Calvani, Fini, and Ranieri (2009) have indicated that the cognitive dimension is one of the three critical dimensions of digital competence. In the digital literacy framework called DigEUIt (Martin and Grudziecki 2006), awareness includes statement and identification, which are the first two steps of a 13-step process for digital literacy. Another information literacy framework, called iSKills (Katz 2007), also contains a 'define' dimension, which refers to the ability to understand and articulate the scope of an information problem. The above-mentioned concepts attempt to measure the degree of awareness of the users and understand their respective literacy levels. Given these facts, we believe that awareness is also an important factor with respect to AI literacy. Some research (Kim 2013; Weisberg 2011) indicated strong relationship between awareness and attitude. Donat, Brandtweiner, and Kerschbaum (2009) also argued that a positive attitude would contribute to people's willingness to use digital products. Thus, we can hypothesize:

H2a: Users' awareness in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their attitude towards AI.

H2b: Users' awareness in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their daily usage of AI applications and products.

*Usage* refers to the ability to apply and exploit AI technology to accomplish tasks proficiently. This construct focuses on operational levels, including easy access to AI applications and tools, proficiency in the operation of AI applications and tools, and capable integration of different types of AI applications and tools. Usage belongs to the technological dimension in the model of Calvani, Fini, and Ranieri (2009) and is common to other related literacies as well (Balfe, Sharples, and Wilson 2018; Katz 2007; Leahy and Dolan 2010). For example, the European Computer Driver License refers to 13 specific skills needed for computer literacy (Leahy and Dolan 2010), such as word processing, spreadsheets, and presentation. iSKills (Katz 2007) also refers to management and information integration for regular usage. In addition, KSAVE (Wilson, Scilise, and Gochyev 2015) also contains skills as an essential aspect of ICT literacy. A few information and media literacy frameworks (Hair et al. 1998; Katz 2007) also include access, which refers to the skills and competencies needed to locate information and media content using the available technologies and associated software. The above-described concepts measure the user's

literacy level from the perspective of use and operation. That is to say, usage in AI literacy will be closely related to users' daily usage of AI products and applications. Also, some researchers (Donat, Brandtweiner, and Kerschbaum 2009; Porter and Donthu 2006) have found that users who use digital products proficiently would hold a positive attitude towards digital technology, which implies that usage in AI literacy will be positively related to users' attitude.

H3a: Users' usage in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their attitude towards AI.

H3b: Users' usage in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their daily usage of AI applications and products.

*Evaluation* refers to the ability to analyze, select, and critically evaluate AI applications and their outcomes. Owing to the complexity and black-box nature of AI (Mueller et al. 2019), the results produced by it require careful consideration and evaluation. Thus, evaluation is an essential competency with respect to AI literacy. Evaluation also plays a critical role in other related literacies (Hallaq 2016; Katz 2007; Martin and Grudziecki 2006). For example, DigEUIt (Martin and Grudziecki 2006) includes analysis, evaluation, and interpretation. Further, both iSKills (Katz 2007) and digital online media literacy (Hallaq 2016) have evaluation in their models as well. In these models, evaluation often refers to the evaluation of information and results; however, in the case of AI literacy, evaluation also requires a user to form accurate opinions regarding AI applications and product. In addition, users who are able to evaluate an AI applications or product usually implies rich experience of using AI applications or products. Thus, we can hypothesize:

H4a: Users' evaluation in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their attitude towards AI.

H4b: Users' evaluation in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their daily usage of AI applications and products.

*Ethics* refers to the ability to be aware of the responsibilities and risks associated with the use of AI technology. In the field of AI, ethical issues have always been a concern of the public. While AI technology brings convenience, it also leads people to think carefully and explicitly about intelligence and ethics within it (Gunkel 2012). Therefore, an AI-literate person must be able to correctly understand and judge ethical issues to ensure that AI technology is used correctly and appropriately. In the case of other related literacies as well, many researchers view ethics as one of the critical components in their frameworks (Calvani et al. 2008; Hallaq 2016;

Wilson and Daugherty 2018). In the digital competence assessment framework (Calvani et al. 2008; Calvani, Fini, and Ranieri 2009), the ethical dimension is one of the three core dimensions of digital literacy. Hallaq (2016) also introduced ethical awareness in his framework of media literacy. Wilson, Scalise, and Gochyev (2015) regarded attitudes, values, and ethics together as the key behaviours and affective aspects related to ICT literacy. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesise that users' ethics in AI literacy will be positively related to their attitude towards AI. For daily usage, abuse of the digital technology usually means low awareness of ethical issues, but some research (Bartsch and Dienlin 2016; Dinev and Hart 2004) indicates that people who use more digital products are more likely to be aware of the issues because they are probably the victims of the abuse. Therefore, we hypothesise:

H5a: Users' ethics in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their attitude towards AI.

H5b: Users' ethics in AI literacy will be positively correlated with their daily usage of AI applications and products.

After synthesising and analogising several related literacies, we propose a framework for AI literacy with four constructs. These constructs lay the foundation for the development of the AI Literacy Scale (AILS). In the sections that follow, we will evaluate whether the proposed four-construct framework is the most suitable one for AI literacy and test the reliability and validity of the proposed instrument. We will then test our hypotheses to explore the relationships between user's AI literacy, attitude, and daily usage.

## 3. Method

One of the purposes of this study was to develop a valid and reliable scale to measure people's AI literacy for future HAI research. After receiving approval from the ethics review board of the authors' university, we developed a standard scale to measure AI literacy. AILS was developed following the recommendations of Hinkin (1998), and its development included the following steps: item generation, content validation, questionnaire administration, item reduction, confirmatory factor analysis, and reliability and validity testing.

### 3.1. Item generation

To capture the four constructs of AI literacy, we generated self-report items through various methods, such as heuristic association, brainstorm, and card sorting. The self-report items in AILS were structured as statements that addressed the behaviour, ability, or level of comfort

when performing specific AI-involving tasks and allowed the respondent to show their degree of agreement with them. This format has been shown to be the most effective one because it allows for the possibility that a respondent may be able to perform a certain task but chooses not to participate in it (Hallaq 2016). To be included, an item had to explicitly capture (at least) one of the four constructs: awareness, usage, evaluation, and ethics. The items were also designed to reflect the literature and to be easy to understand for ordinary people. Besides, to prevent the questionnaire from becoming obsolete in a short time due to the rapid development of AI technology, the items were narrated from a more general perspective rather than asking specific applications. Then the items were compared for theoretical deficiency and redundancy within each construct. The items that did not meet the above criteria were eliminated in this step. Finally, we obtained a total of 65 items with the number of items per dimension ranging from 10 to 24.

### 3.2. Content validation

To measure awareness, usage, evaluation, and ethics, 24, 16, 15, and 10 items were evaluated, respectively. Five subject matter experts (SMEs) were recruited for this part of the study. Three of the SMEs were PhD candidates in the field of human-computer interactions, who had prior experience in scale development and research concerning AI or robotics. The other two SMEs were PhD candidates in computer science and automation. It should be noted that using a small sample of students for content validity assessment was considered appropriate, since this was a cognitive task that did not require an understanding of the phenomena under examination (Anderson and Gerbing 1991; Hinkin 1998; Schriesheim et al. 1993). The definitions of the four AI literacy constructs were personally explained to all the SMEs to ensure they understood the meaning of each construct. Subsequently, content validation was performed in the following three steps.

Following the approach proposed by Schriesheim et al. (1993), the SMEs were first asked to classify each item into one of the four constructs. They were also provided with an 'unclassified' category for items that were deemed to not fit any of the constructs. An item was considered to clearly address a construct if at least four of the five SMEs classified it in a similar manner. A total of 42 items matched this criterion, with 15 items being unclassified or classified incorrectly by one SME. Further, 23 items were unclassified or classified incorrectly by more than one SME; these items were excluded from the rest of the steps.

Next, we used the approach proposed by Hinkin (1985). The SMEs were asked to review the items selected in the first step and rate them on a three-point Likert scale on the extent to which each item corresponded to the construct: 1 = no fit, 2 = moderate fit, 3 = good fit. An item was accepted if at least three SMEs thought it was a 'good fit' and no SME thought it was 'no fit'. Using this criterion, 10 items were eliminated, while 31 items were selected for the remaining steps.

Finally, three of the SMEs were asked to participate in a focus group to supplement the items (i.e. questions) and improve their wording and format. The other two SMEs, who were unable to join the focus group, were interviewed separately by the authors. After the completion of the focus group discussion and interviews, two items were eliminated, and 14 items were rephrased. We also included an additional item that had been proposed and approved by all the SMEs. In this manner, a 31-item scale was obtained, wherein nine items are related to AI awareness, nine items to AI usage, six items to AI evaluation, and seven items to AI ethics. We ensured that each item was structured in a manner conducive to obtaining accurate responses.

### 3.3. Questionnaire administration

AIILS is formatted in the form of a seven-point Likert scale. Though both Likert (1932) and Hinkin (1998) have recommended that new items be scaled using a five-point Likert scale, other researchers (Cox 1980; Pett, Lackey, and Sullivan 2003) have shown that scales with five to seven levels are also appropriate. Moreover, a recent study (Finstad 2010) suggested that seven-point scales are more suitable for electronically distributed usability surveys. Given that our questionnaire is to be distributed online, we considered a seven-point Likert scale to be more appropriate.

AIILS was developed to be presented in an electronic format on computers or smartphones so that it can be transmitted and distributed readily through the

Internet. However, some researchers (Beach 1989; Pettit 2002) have pointed out that computer-based surveys are more likely to result in random responses and non-responses as compared to the paper-and-pencil method. To counter this disadvantage of electronic surveys, we incorporated an attentiveness question to help the researchers distinguish those respondents who may have answered the survey questions in a random manner. This technique has been employed frequently by many researchers (Hallaq 2016; Hargittai 2005) to ensure that they only consider those respondents who have paid close attention to the survey.

We collected two sets of samples, Sample 1, and Sample 2, through two different methods. Sample 1 was to be used for item reduction, while Sample 2 was to be used for model validation and confirmation. The participants for Sample 1 were recruited through social media and a professional survey company. Of the 684 participants who completed the online survey, 83 were removed for not answering the attentiveness question correctly. The final sample size was 601, and the sample was 55.91% female and 44.09% male. The age of the participants ranged from 16 to 57, with the mean age being 26.55 ( $SD = 6.29$ ). Sample 2 was collected by the professional survey company. Of the 363 participants who completed the online survey, 38 were removed for not answering the attentiveness question correctly. The final sample size was 325, and the sample was 55.69% female and 44.31% male. Further, the age of the participants ranged from 17 to 65, with the mean age being 29.67 ( $SD = 7.33$ ). As for education, most of the participants in Sample 1 (72.21%) and Sample 2 (84.92%) had a bachelor's degree. The details of the participants are summarised in Table 1.

In Sample 2, we incorporated three additional measures into the questionnaire for examining criterion validity and test the hypotheses. The first measure was a popular digital literacy scale developed by Ng (2012) to measure people's literacy in information and communication technology. The scale included six questions for

the technical dimension, two for the cognitive dimension, and two for the social-emotional dimension. For attitude, we incorporated Negative Attitude towards Robots Scale (NARS), which measured people's attitudes towards communication robots or agents in daily life (Nomura, Kanda, and Suzuki 2006) from the negative dimension. The reason for choosing NARS was that the scale was one of the most popular instruments in recent HAI or human robot interaction research field. NARS also consisted of three constructs: attitudes towards situations of interaction with robots (S1), attitudes towards social influence of robots (S2), and attitudes towards emotions in interaction with robots (S3). In the third measure, we included five questions based on the system usage model of Burton-Jones (2005) to measure the people's daily usage of AI technology. The five questions were derived from five aspects: extent of use, variety of use, frequency of use, proportion of use, and duration of use. These three measures would not only serve as criteria for criterion validity analysis but also helped us understand the relationship between AI literacy and other related factors.

## 4. Results and analysis

### 4.1. Item reduction

The item reduction process aimed to ensure that a fair number of items representing the four AILS constructs was retained, thus providing evidence of construct validity (Hinkin 1998). Item reduction can also reduce participants' cognitive load and thus increase the usability of the scale. We limited the number of items to around 10 in our final scale, making it palatable for AI

researchers to include, especially when they want to use it for pre-screening or post-task evaluation. For this purpose, we performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). EFA is a technology used to find out the essential structure of multivariate observation variables and deal with dimensionality reduction. Therefore, EFA can synthesise the variables with complex relationships into a few core factors. We calculated the item-total correlations to select the suitable items for the four constructs. All the analyses related to item reduction were performed on Sample 1.

We first checked the suitability of the data for factor analysis through Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test, which confirmed that the sample was suitable for EFA with coefficient value of 0.95. The scree plot and parallel analysis results as well as the number of eigenvalues greater than 1.00 suggested a four-factor solution, shown in Figure 1.

Thus, we ran a four-factor EFA with the diagonal rotation and minimum residual estimation. In this step, we wanted to ensure that the items matched the theoretical structure and to identify any items that were cross loaded in more than one construct. The results of the EFA are shown in Table 2.

Next, we used confirmation factor analysis (CFA). Different from EFA, CFA is a process of using sample data to verify the factor structure hypothesis made according to some theories and a priori knowledge. In confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure established according to the existing theory can form an estimated covariance matrix. We performed CFA for each subscale to check the factor loadings for their respective constructs. We also determined the item-total correlations to check if any items on the scale were inconsistent with the average behaviour of the others. The item

Note. Items in **boldface** are included in the final scale. Factor loadings less than .30 are suppressed. Awa. = Awareness, Usa. = Usage, Eva. = Evaluation, Eth. = Ethics.  $\chi^2(601) = 483.36, p < .0001$ , Tucker-Lewis index of factoring reliability is .98, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is .03, root mean square of the residuals (RSMR) is .02.

loadings and item-total correlation results for each of the four constructs are listed in **Table 3**. We selected the following items: (a) those with factor loadings higher than 0.30 (Costello and Osborne 2005); (b) those with item-total correlation coefficients higher than 0.60 (Hair et al. 1998); (c) those with the highest three item-total correlation coefficients; and (d) those that did not exhibit redundancy with respect to the other high-loading and high-item-total-correlation items. Eventually, twelve items emerged from the 31 items with three items for each construct.

### 4.2. Model validation and comparison

After finalising the items in the scale, we confirmed whether the theoretical model used was the best one for measuring AI literacy. For this, we conducted a series of CFAs on Sample 2. The results are shown in

**Table 4.** We found that the theoretical model used for AI literacy was an acceptable one (CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.99, GFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.01, SRMR = 0.03). In addition, we also performed CFAs to test four competing, theoretically meaningful models: a single-factor model, where all 12 items are loaded onto one factor; a two-factor model, where the items measuring awareness and ethics (cognitive level) are loaded onto one factor while those for usage and evaluation (technological level) are loaded onto the other factor; a three-factor model, where the items measuring awareness (cognitive level) are loaded onto one factor, those measuring usage and evaluation (technological level) are loaded onto another factor, and those measuring ethics (ethical level) are loaded onto the third factor; and a four-factor model, where the awareness, usage, evaluation, and ethics items are loaded onto four individual factors. The fit statistics for the four models are listed in **Table 4**. The results suggest that the four-factor model exhibited better fit statistics than the other models, which indicates that the theoretical model based on four distinct constructs was the most appropriate for conceptualizing AI literacy. The descriptions and loadings of the twelve items for the finalised scale are shown in **Table 5**.

### 4.3. Reliability and construct validity

The reliability and validity of AILS were determined using Cronbach's alpha as well as the composite reliability (CR), average variance extracted (AVE), and heterotrait-monotrait ratio of the correlations (HTMT). The results are presented in Table 6. Cronbach's alpha is an index used to measure reliability, and a value greater than 0.7 is considered acceptable (DeVellis 2016). The value of Cronbach's alpha for AILS was 0.83, whereas the alpha values for the four constructs were 0.73, 0.75, 0.78, and 0.73, respectively. Though all four constructs exhibited reliabilities of more than 0.70, the instrument itself scored higher than 0.80, which indicated that the instrument in its entirety is more reliable than the separate constructs.

According to the criterion established by Fornell and Larcker (1981), CR and AVE were used to assess the scale's convergent validity. CR is a less biased estimate of reliability than Cronbach's alpha, and CR values of

0.70 and higher are considered acceptable (Hair et al. 1998). AVE measures the level of variance captured by a construct versus that attributable to measurement error. Values greater than 0.5 indicate adequate convergence (Hair et al. 1998); thus, the average factor loadings should be larger than 0.72 to ensure AVE values greater than 0.5. However, in some cases, and especially for a new instrument, factor loadings higher than 0.5 (i.e. AVE > 0.25) could be considered acceptable (e.g. Hsu and Wu 2013; Hu 2013; Mayerl 2016). In our scale, CR values were higher than 0.7, and AVE values were close to 0.5, which indicated acceptable convergence. Discriminant validity was measured based on the HTMT approach proposed by Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2015). It suggested that the HTMT should not be higher than 0.85 for high discriminant validity (Clark and Watson 1995; Kline 2015). In the case of the proposed scale, the results showed that the HTMT values of all four constructs were lower than the threshold of 0.85, indicating acceptable discriminant validity for the instrument. In addition, almost all correlations among the four constructs are between .15 and .50, which were also considered ideal according to Clark and Watson (2016).

### 4.4. Hypothesis test results

The correlations for hypothesis testing are presented in Table 7. The result partly proved the Hypothesis H1a. As we mentioned, AI literacy and digital literacy might share some overlapping parts. Hypothesis H1b suggested that the participants' AI literacy would be positively correlated with their attitude towards AI. Results suggested that AI literacy was significantly and negatively correlated with NARS, S1, S2, and S3, thus supporting H1b. Hypothesis H1c was partly supported as AI literacy was only significantly and positively correlated with the extent, variety, and frequency of use of AI technology in daily life. Results supported Hypothesis H2a, finding that the awareness was significantly and negatively correlated with NARS and NARS S1. Hypothesis H2b was also partly supported, as the awareness in AILS was significantly and positively correlated

with the extent, variety, and frequency of use of AI technology in daily life. Hypotheses H3a and H3b suggested that the usage in AI literacy would be positively correlated with attitude and daily use of AI technology, respectively, and the results supported both hypotheses. The results indicated that the usage was significantly and negatively correlated with NARS and NARS S1. Results also indicated that the usage in AI literacy was significantly and positively with the extent, variety, frequency, proportion, and duration of use of AI technology in daily life. Hypothesis H4a was fully supported as the evaluation was significantly and negatively correlated with NARS, S1, S2, and S3. Results partly supported Hypothesis H4b, finding that the evaluation was significant and positively correlated with the extent, variety, and frequency of use of AI technology in daily life. For hypotheses H5a and H5b, the results only supported H5a, finding that the ethics was significantly and negatively correlated with NARS and NARS S1. The ethics was found to have nothing to do with daily usage. In addition, the results indicated a close relationship between AI literacy and digital literacy as digital literacy was significantly and positively with AI literacy, awareness, usage, evaluation, and ethics.

To demonstrate the predictive power of the four constructs of AILS, we conducted a multiple regression of participants' AI literacy on their digital literacy, negative attitude towards robots, and daily usage of AI technology. The results of the regression are presented in Table 8. The Cronbach's alpha of digital literacy scale was 0.83, but the alpha of the two subscales (cognitive dimension and social-emotional dimension) were far below 0.70 (0.39 and 0.39, respectively). Thus, we only used the digital literacy scale in its entirety for predictive criterion. Results suggested that the four constructs of AILS combined explained 58% of the variance in reported digital literacy. All four constructs turned out to be significant predictors of digital literacy. For NARS and its subscales, the values of Cronbach's alpha were 0.88, 0.80, 0.80, and 0.80. The results suggested that the four constructs of AILS combined explained 13%, 17%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, of the variance in NARS and its subscales. Awareness and evaluation were significant negative predictors for both NARS and NARS S1 (attitudes towards situations of interaction with robots). But for NARS S2 (attitudes towards social influence of robots) and S3 (attitudes towards emotions in interaction with robots), evaluation was the only factor predicting the results.

In terms of users' daily usage of AI technology, we explored its relationship with AILS from five aspects. The four constructs of AILS combined explained 19% of the variance in the extent of use, while awareness, usage, and ethics were significant predictors. The four constructs of AILS combined explained 23% of the variance for the variety of use, while usage and evaluation emerged as significant predictors. Both frequency of use and proportion of use were determined to have significant relationship with usage, evaluation, and ethics with explained variances of 17% and 10%. For the duration of usage, usage was the only significant predictor, and the four constructs of AILS explained 7% of its

variance. Across the five dimensions of daily use, the construct usage emerged as the most significant predictor while other constructs, which share enough explained variance, were below significance as unique predictors.

## 5. Discussion and conclusions

This study aimed to improve our understanding of AI literacy by developing and validating a novel measure of AI literacy. The proposed scale, namely, AILS, is based on the conceptually similar idea of digital literacy suggested by Balfé, Sharples, and Wilson (2018) and Calvani et al. (2008). The theoretical basis for their approach to digital literacy led us to believe that a similar framework may be applicable in the case of AI literacy as well. Using a six-step approach, we were able to demonstrate the reliability and validity of AILS. The results of factor analyses indicated that the theoretical model based on four distinct constructs is the most appropriate conceptualization model for AI literacy. Although the AVE values of some constructs were slightly lower than the threshold value of 0.50, the whole scale proved to have sufficient convergence validity. The other indicators, such as CR and HTMT, also suggested sufficient construct validity.

In the hypotheses testing, most of the hypotheses have been verified. AI literacy and the four constructs were found to be negatively correlated with negative attitude towards robots (NARS) and negative attitude towards situations of interaction with robots (NARS S1). The extent, variety, and frequency of use of AI technology were found to be correlated with AI literacy and the four constructs except ethics. The results of the correlation and the regression showed that digital literacy and AILS were closely related, which could be intuitively explained: digital literacy is a prerequisite for AI literacy since most of today's AI technology is embedded in digital products. It might come from the section based on the digital literacy. The regression results also indicated that awareness and evaluation in AILS played an important role in predicting users' negative attitudes towards robots. This could be attributed to the fact that awareness and evaluation represented users' cognition and judgement of AI, which would affect their attitudes towards robots in the end. In terms of users' daily AI usage, the results that the construct of usage in AILS showed a significant relationship with user's daily behaviour in using AI technology were not surprising. The findings indicated that AILS is an important predictor of user's attitude and behaviour towards AI technology usage. In general, these results indicated that AILS is suitable to measure AI literacy.

Several points need to be noted when applying AILS to use in practice. The first one is that the constructs alone are less reliable than the instrument as a composite. Though all four constructs exhibited reliabilities of more than 0.70, the instrument itself scored higher than 0.80. The recommendation then is to use the instrument in its entirety rather than the individual constructs. It should also be noted the correlation between AILS and digital literacy was high, which does not mean that AI literacy and digital literacy can be used interchangeably. As discussed in the literature review, the definitions of AI and ICT are different, and users have different perceptions of the two technologies, which would lead to different attitudes and use of the two kinds of products. Thus, it is recommended for researchers and practitioners to use the AILS for user research involving AI technology. It is worth noting that users are likely to mistake AI literacy for competence of using specific applications, given that AI is usually embedded in the applications. As user competence regarding different applications varies significantly, it is likely to cause an inconsistency in the results. Thus, we recommend using AILS to measure users' general AI competence rather than the ability to use specific AI applications. Finally, AI literacy might relate to the digital literacy, we recommend using the outcome to explore the association between AI literacy and digital literacy.

This study has certain limitations. First, this study does not address all concerns regarding AI literacy, and much work remains to be done on this topic. For instance, future studies should examine other theoretically meaningful structures. It is also worth noting that both samples scored highly on AILS, meaning that either the respondents possessed high levels of literacy or that the attitude-based nature of the scale, wherein the respondents report their levels of agreement with the statements regarding AI, fails to accurately assess their understanding of AI. It is also possible that the respondents who completed the survey online have more experience in using AI applications. Hence, the relationship between digital literacy and AI literacy is worth investigating in the future. In addition, we must recognise the limitations of the SMEs. Although they had training in the relevant analysis methods and work in related fields, they are PhD students. Future studies should examine whether AI researchers have different conceptualizations of the content and items included in the measure.

That said, this study lays the foundation for future research on the effects of AI literacy on various outcomes. We have provided a comprehensive definition of AI literacy and created a well-defined four-factor

model. Further, we have developed a short 12-item measure to provide researchers and practitioners with a tool for assessing the self-report competence of users in using AI. By defining the AI literacy domain and providing effective measurement tools, we hope to improve and encourage future research in this area. For example, one domain that may benefit significantly from this work is explainable AI. The explanations provided by intelligent systems or agents also improve users' literacy, leading to a better collaboration with the systems or the agents (Zhou, Itoh, and Kitazaki 2021). Moreover, the conceptualization of AI literacy and the development of suitable tools for measuring it will help designers to portray accurate user model and subsequently design appropriate explainable AI systems based on these models. Finally, because the proposed model and the scale based on it define and capture the constructs of AI literacy, researchers will be able to discern more nuanced relationships between AI literacy and user experience in HAI research.
