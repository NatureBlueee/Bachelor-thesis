# The Problem of Generations

WHAT STRIKES the psychologist forcefully when he surveys the available literature on adolescence and youth is that, if the amount of discussion were indicative, then all or nearly all problems of youth would appear to be those of the adolescent male. True, the more serious authors nod in the direction of female adolescence and recognize that it creates problems, too. But having done so, they turn so exclusively to the problems of the male adolescent that the net impression remains: female adolescence, if it exists at all, does not create problems equally worthy of the sociologist's or the psychologist's interest.

But whether we view adolescent development from a sociological or a psychological viewpoint, the problems confronting boys and girls should be parallel. The reassertion of sexual desires on reaching physical maturity is typical of both sexes, as are the psychological problems of repressing or satisfying these drives; of postponing the consummation of some and of sublimating the rest. So also, in modern times, are the social and psychological problems of achieving self-identity on a more mature basis, and of finding one's place in society.

Is it really so much easier for the adolescent girl to find her self-identity as a woman and her place in society, than for the boy to gain his as a man? True, Erikson describes cases of negative identity in women, but most of his writings on adolescence concern males, and other recent students of the problem such as Friedenberg and Goodman deal almost wholly with male youth.<sup>1</sup> Though Freud's original work was based on the study of hysteria in females, and though he devoted much thought to their difficulties in achieving sexual maturity, a problem typical of middle-class youth, his later writings centered mainly on the development of the male. In an-

# *The Problem of Generations*

other context I have discussed how, in regard to puberty rites, nearly all psychoanalytic interest centers on boys, neglecting the far-reaching meaning the rites have for both boys and girls in achieving sexual maturity and adult status.<sup>2</sup>

Since I, too, have had to rely on available sources, and since they are so much richer in content and more abundant than any one man's observations can be, my discussion too will be weighted toward male youth; but at least I wish to acknowledge this deficiency in my remarks, and try to rectify it in part. I venture to say that those who conceived of this issue of *Dædalus* were caught in much the same predicament, since a careful reading of the suggestions they kindly offered me permits a consideration of the feminine only by stretching the points they detailed. Yet there must be a reason why the male adolescent and his problems dominate public attention and that of the scholarly expert.

Perhaps my particular topic allows for a first approximation as to why this is so: I was asked to discuss the problem of the generations from the psychologist's point of view. Unfortunately I shall have to transgress heavily into the field of sociology, since in my opinion the problem of generations is at best a psychosocial one, and can never be dealt with on a purely psychological basis.

It may be that the problem of generations is what gives us adults so much trouble, and not the problems of adolescence or youth; and this is why, when we concern ourselves with the problem of youth in our society, it is that of male youth. If delinquency worries us, it is chiefly male delinquency, though to their families and themselves, female delinquents are at least as great a problem.

For the same reason we are concerned with Johnny's not learning to read, or not getting enough science and math, as if reading problems were foreign to Jane, or as if she were automatically good at math and science. And if not, it is thought to matter little, since the number of female contributors to the sciences is relatively negligible. But such an evaluation of women's potential is both shortsighted and wasteful. Despite all the obstacles to women's higher education in the physical sciences, it was a young woman who did pioneering work in radioactivity, a development in physics which eventually led to the present clamor for more science education in our schools.

Since it is adults who conduct the studies and write the articles, and since these adults are predominantly male, they write most of

where the shoe pinches them—that is, in regard to the problem of generations. They are neglectful of where the shoe hurts the young—that is, with the problem of sexual maturity and with finding one's place in society. True, each of these is well recognized as problematic, but especially so where they coincide with what is bothersome to adults, the relation of the generations to each other. They are neglected where they trouble adults less, as in the female.

I hasten to add that this respite in regard to the girls' part in the problem of generations is fast disappearing. I submit that already it creates more emotional hardship than that of the males, which at least is officially recognized. Why, then, is the problem of generations so much more acute in the male than in the female?

To put it crassly: the self-identity, and even more the self-realization of the young man, implies to a large degree his replacing the preceding generation. In order to come into his own, the old man (or whoever stands in his place) must move over; or, in the folklore of my native Austria, he must move into the old people's quarters (*Ausgedinge*). This happens as soon as the son is ready to take over the farm, and with it, all other prerogatives including the main building: the farmhouse.

Such ascendency of youth over old age proceeds smoothly, at the right age and in the correct form, if it tallies with the survival needs of the entire family and with the facts of biology, in short, if it takes place in concordance with nature and nurture. The well-being of the farm family depended on a vigorous male being in charge at least of the farming, if not also of the family. For centuries most men lived on farms tilled by small landholders or serf-tenants, or else made a living as small artisans or shopkeepers. In those times economic success and often mere survival depended on the physical strength and skill of the head of the family. So it seemed "natural" that as the father's vigor declined, a son just reaching the prime of his strength and mental abilities should take over.

When this was so, and since the father's life was meaningful, that of the son who at first helped him and then followed in his footsteps was automatically meaningful, too. An old Chinese proverb summed things up: "He who has sons cannot long remain poor; he who has none cannot remain rich." This was something both fathers and sons understood. The son growing up was secure in everyone's knowledge that he added substantially to the economic well-being of the family. Seeing also that his contributions increased in importance as he approached maturity and the peak of his physical

strength, just as his father was declining in vigor, he had no need to worry about his work achievement (as would now come through more indirect employment on the labor market) and whether it supported his claim to have reached manhood.

Such an easy succession of the generations, even in times past, was mainly an "ideal" solution to the changing of the guards. But actuality often approached this ideal; and if not, the biological realities made it seem like the given order of things, since production depended so largely on the male's prowess.

True, even when the level of technology was so low that physical strength counted most, one's experience and skill, the know-how of work and of life, had to be added to strength to succeed; but all one's experience and knowledge were of little avail without physical strength, because it alone powered the economic process. There was no point, therefore, in a selfish holding on to knowledge or even to property rights, because they were only theoretical if they could bring no return, once physical power had failed.

While there were always some old men who held on beyond reason, along with other conflicts of interest and generations, these were clearly men smitten with blindness or carried away by unreasonable emotions. An intelligent self-interest in both old and young still required a transition of power and privilege at the point when physical decline set in among the aging and manhood was gained by the young. An old man might stand in the way of his sons, but his fate was then ordained. Thus O'Neill's Ephraim Cabot is unwilling to recognize his son's contribution; but when the son walks off, not with the farm but with his father's young wife, the father ends up in possession of a farm that he alone cannot tend to.

It is when physical strength is no longer essential for survival or economic success that the biological process of aging as well as of maturing no longer, of necessity, conditions the taking over of the dominant position by youth. What once formed the "ideal" solution, because conditioned by the nature of man, suddenly turns into an arbitrary "ideal" without any necessary or natural basis. Such an ideal soon becomes hard to put into practice, and eventually even ceases to be an ideal.<sup>3</sup>

Even before modern times, wherever physical strength was not essential to survival because the life-assuring labor was performed by others, the problem of generations was acute. This was true, for example, of former ruling classes, and later on of the upper middle classes. It was also true in the Greece of Alcibiades and in Catiline's

Rome. Whenever there was no natural order to the ascendancy of the generations, problems arose between them similar to those that are now typical for all in a machine age, when almost nobody's survival depends on physical strength.

If the young man's coming into his place as head of the living unit is not thus assured by the natural order of things, if he cannot be sure that the dominant position will be his at a foreseeable and not too distant moment, then he cannot wait for it in good grace. Then he must fight for it, for both his rights and his obligations, and the sooner the better, because only both in their combination make for the realm of the mature man.

If such a transition does not occur smoothly, is not accepted as natural and inevitable by both partners, then the older generation is likely to view the younger with suspicion, and justifiably so, because youth taking over is no longer necessary and natural. Why should the older generation voluntarily abdicate if it has nothing to gain by it and loses nothing by holding on?

Many if not most adults have an emotional need for children and enjoy bringing them up. It is such a truism that children for their part need their parents for physical and emotional survival that I mention it only to round out the picture. Once childhood is past, however, the picture changes. At certain times in history the older generation had an emotional need to see its way of life continued by the coming generations. This was particularly true when the parent generation had begun a work it could not complete and which it felt would remain pointless if uncompleted, be it the clearing of the land or the raising of a cathedral. Yet the more we came to doubt that things would continue in the old ways, that we were toiling for eternity, the less emotional need was felt by the older generation for the next one to continue what it so auspiciously had begun.

With the advent of modern technology and mass society, only very few have so intimate a feeling for their life's work, such a personal investment in it, that they need to see it continued by others. Short of such a desire, the older generation has little psychological need for youth. If youth tends to move away and build a life very different from that of the old folk, whom they only sporadically remember or visit on special occasions, then even the hope for emotional comfort from youth becomes unrealistic. While youth may still have some emotional and economic need for parents, most parents have little emotional need, and very few an economic one, for a youth striving to be free of its elders. It is because parents still

# *The Problem of Generations*

have an emotional need for children, but not for an independent youth, that they often show strenuous resistance when youth fights for its independence. It is also what makes them so critical of certain exaggerations or passing effects of youth's battle for self-realization.

Such resentment and ambivalence about youth's striking out on its own matters little if youth can readily remove itself from the impact. The development of youngsters who went West or ran away to sea was not hampered by adult criticism of their ventures, though their development to full emotional maturity may have known other vagaries. But if youth stays at home or close to home and still fights for its independence from those it depends on, both sides show an emotional deficit.

The resultant scarring of personality in a delinquent youth, for example, is recognized by society as serious. The misanthropic nagging and dissatisfaction of his elders are less well recognized as the price they pay for the conflict. Hamlet thus has his counterpart in King Lear, who, unwilling to make room for youth, tries instead to put reins on the younger generation and to saddle it with a burden of gratitude. It is poetic justice that Cordelia, willing to serve age by foregoing the right of youth to a life of its own, suffers destruction, too.

In the psychoanalytic literature certain aspects of the problem of youth are traced back to a revival and a more violent acting out of the oedipal situation in adolescence. And it is true; something akin to the oedipal situation may be found among the children of most known societies. Specific variations will depend on who is head of the family and to what degree; the character of the persons who minister to the child; how large or small the family is; and how intense or weak is the emotional attachment of specific family members to one another and to the child. But the same cannot be said for the repetition of oedipal conflicts in adolescence.

The girl who marries at fifteen or sixteen and soon thereafter has children of her own is not likely to be beset by a repetition of her oedipal longings for her father or by any fierce competition with her mother for his emotions. As suggested earlier, the repetition of the oedipal conflict is not an issue of nature but depends very much on the structure of family and society.

Only a youth who is kept (or keeps himself) economically and emotionally dependent on the older generation will experience the repetition of the conflict that psychoanalysts observe so frequently

nowadays among middle-class adolescents. To cite Hamlet again as the most familiar instance of a revived oedipal conflict in youth—if Hamlet, like Fortinbras, had fought for a kingdom across the sea instead of wishing to inherit his father's place, no tragedy would have taken place; but because he wished to take over from a generation unwilling to yield, rather than to find and win a world of his own, the old oedipal feelings were reactivated and led to the tragedy that destroyed them all. If Hamlet had known for sure what he wished to achieve on his own in life, he could not have been pressed into becoming the avenger of his father. For Hamlet's father, like Lear, put a private burden on his child's too weak shoulders.

Here, then, is another aspect of the conflict of generations: the parent who sees his child's main task in life as the duty to execute his will or to justify his existence (which is different from a parent's devotion to an unfinished labor which the child, on his own, later wishes to bring to fruition). The son who does not revolt when he is expected to devote his life only or mainly to achieving what the parent could not, usually perishes as Hamlet did.

In the present-day world with its tamer middle-class society, we find that the conflicts between a youth either afraid of or prevented from coming into its own and an older generation unwilling or unable to give way, are no less tragic though played out in more muted tones. It follows that whenever society is so organized that youth remains dependent on the older generation, because of the duration of the educational process or for other reasons, and this older generation is not ready to step aside economically, politically or emotionally, a psychological impasse is created which may then be aggravated by unresolved oedipal conflicts.

Here it might be well to remind ourselves that no oedipal situation would exist if the parents were not deeply involved with their child. The revival of the oedipal conflict in adolescence is often due to a parents' wish or need to remain as important to his child in adolescence as he was during infancy.

I venture to guess that many more (particularly middle-class) youths come to grief nowadays because of their parents' insistence that the former justify them as parents than because of any revived oedipal desire for their mothers or fathers. (This again is different from youth's independent wish to prove its own worth and not the worth of a parent.) One form of such an insistence is the overt and covert pressure on youth to provide the parents with what

was lacking in their own lives. The mother's pressure on her daughter to live out vicariously her unfulfilled daydreams of popularity or to make a notable marriage can effectively block the girl's efforts to find self-realization in ways that are genuine to her. Often it is both parents who expect their sons to excel in athletics and who take for granted their right to assume that their child will do better than they did.

Nowadays it is usually both middle-class parents who put pressure on youth of both sexes to enter the prestige colleges; this pressure is reinforced by a parallel one from the schools and the general public. I have found those parents most insistent and most unreasonable in such demands who never went to college themselves or never graduated.<sup>4</sup> Many a college youngster needs to ward off this undue attempt to run his life as his parents or teachers want, and longs to carve his own way. He decides that the only way to manage this is to drink, do poorly in college, or flunk out. That is not his original desire; he acts out of a necessity to prove himself master of his own fate.

All this is only part of an attitude that expects American children to do better than their parents, and often, seen objectively, the task is even quite feasible; but to children and adolescents the demand seems emotionally impossible, because it comes at a time when their opinion of their parents' achievements is unrealistically high. Contrary to all psychoanalytic writings that teach clearly how the child and adolescent is overawed by his parents' power and wisdom, both society and his parents continue to expect the emotionally impossible of youth. Off-hand, I can recall no single statement in which consideration of what is expected of high school and college youth is directly linked to the achievement of the youth's parents. While we are more than ready to praise the self-made man, we are reluctant to apply the correlate of such praise: to recognize how difficult it is to outdo one's parents.

True, many youngsters end up doing better than their parents, either socially, economically, or intellectually; but I wonder how the score would show up on a balance sheet that also took account of emotional well-being. A vast number have risen in this way, but then they have hardly been able to manage life, even with the help of a psychoanalyst. If we consider, in evaluating those who do better in life than their parents, not only the externals but also the inner life, perhaps the picture of success that emerges would give us food for second thoughts.

To put the burden of surpassing one's parents on the relations between parent and child leads of necessity to unresolvable conflicts. If youth succeeds, it emasculates the parent. As a result, youth cannot feel successful—partly out of guilt, and partly because he cannot be sure if it was he or his parent who wanted him to succeed. That is, he cannot be sure who it is that truly structures his life.

As for the older generation, the conflict shows many faces. It may take the form of contempt if youth does not fight back (they are weak) or of hostile anxiety if it does (they are delinquent). And if youth has serious doubts about whether it will ever succeed, it must still either rebel or submit in cowardly fashion, or else find some devious (neurotic) way to sidetrack the issue. (To be neither son nor man avoids the fight altogether and hurts the father most, as when the son is a "beat.") Hence the eternal historic and dramatic predicament of the crown prince: if he submits to his father's superannuated clinging to office, he will be a weakening when he finally inherits the throne. If he rejects a role of empty waiting, he must head the revolt against his father.

But what about the girl? Must her mother abdicate for her to come into her own? Not as long as her psychosocial identity resides in childbearing and homemaking. The older generation may stand in her husband's way of realizing his independence, but as long as she accepts that her independence as a social being rests on his, the older generation may stand in her husband's way but it does not stand in hers. Her mother does not need to move over for her to be herself. On the contrary, the mother's having reached an age when childbearing is no longer possible or becoming makes it obvious to one and all who is now in ascendance, and no fight between the generations is needed to settle the issue. (Some modern mothers who cannot accept their gray hair and fading looks, and with it their sexual decline, create a problem for their daughters similar to that of the boy's.)

But what if the girl's psychosocial identity ceases to reside in childbearing and homemaking, or exclusively so? Until the industrial era, as Veblen saw, woman's social identity was "essentially and normally a vicarious one," an expression of the man's life at second remove. And so long as she remained (of necessity) a drudge, she accepted this ancillary role and was largely at peace with her lot. But the less this became true, the more her problems of identity and self-realization were compounded. By now, the female adoles-

# *The Problem of Generations*

cent struggles not only with having to decide whether her place is in the home or in society at large, or in both, but to what degree and with what justification. Thus the problems of youth have become nearly the same for both sexes; the sexual difference counts for less, because the conflicts of growing up are so much more psychosocial than sexual.

This, I believe, is one of the reasons why psychoanalysis is so often ineffective in adolescence—not because the sexual pressures are so great, and they are great, but because psychoanalysis, which is so well able to help with problems of sex and repression and personal self-realization, does not help with the problem of social self-realization. Or, to put it differently, pitting a helpful authority (the analyst) against repressive authority figures still leaves the adolescent under the sway of some adult authority which he needs to replace with his own. Or, to put it yet differently: psychoanalysis is devised for and effective in helping persons with their intrapersonal difficulties; hence it tends to approach all problems as such. But the problem of the generations is an interpersonal difficulty. Therefore, to deal with it as if it were intrapersonal only complicates matters instead of simplifying them, and makes resolving them less likely.

Of course, this also is true only for Western middle class society. How the problem of generations can differ in different cultures may be illustrated by a controversy between American and Japanese psychoanalysts: in Japan the psychoanalyst's task was seen to consist in helping the young individual to give up his search for self-identity; his self-realization was to be sought not in individuation but in accepting his place within the family in the traditional subservient position of the son toward his father. Thus a Japanese patient "as he approached the successful conclusion of his treatment said, 'During my vacation my mother told me on one occasion that I was now pleasing my father better again.' The psychoanalyst, in reviewing the changes in the patient's personality, says, 'His psychic state is now as harmonious a one as can ever be reached by human beings' i.e., in accordance with the national mores and aspirations of Japan."<sup>5</sup>

Most serious writers on the problem of youth have recognized that youth's present difficulties in Western society are closely related to changed social and economic conditions and to the ensuing difficulty for youth in finding self-realization in work. As Goodman

observes: "It's hard to grow up when there isn't enough man's work," and he continues, "To produce necessary food and shelter is man's work. During most of economic history most men have done this drudging work, secure that it was justified and worthy of a man to do it, though often feeling that the social conditions under which they did it were not worthy of a man, thinking, 'It's better to die than to live so hard'—but they worked on. . . . Security is always first; but in normal conditions a large part of security comes from knowing your contribution is useful, and the rest from knowing it's uniquely yours: they need you."⁶

Just as in this country an earlier generation needed youth because the economic security of the family depended on its contribution, so in Russia today youth is needed because only it can carry on the task of creating the new and better society; and in Africa because only it can move society from tribal confusion toward modern democracy. If the generations thus need each other, they can live together successfully, and the problem of their succession, though not negligible, can be mastered successfully. Under such conditions youth and age need each other not only for their economic but even more for their moral survival. This makes youth secure—if not in its position, at least in its self-respect. But how does the parent in modern society need the next generation? Certainly not for economic reasons any more, and what little expectation a parent may have had that his children would support him in old age becomes superfluous with greater social security. More crucially, the status-quo mood of the older generation suggests no need for youth to create a much different or radically better world.

In many respects youth has suddenly turned from being the older generation's greatest economic asset into its greatest economic liability. Witness the expense of rearing and educating youth for some twenty or more years, with no economic return to be expected. Youth still poses emotional problems to the preceding generation, as of old. But in past generations these emotional problems were, so to speak, incidental or subservient to economic necessity. What at best was once the frosting on the cake must now serve as both solid food and trimmings—and this will never work.

Thus the economic roles, obligations, and rewards are no longer clearly defined between the generations, if not turned upside down. Therefore, another aspect of the relation between the generations looms ever larger, in a balance sheet of interaction that is no longer economic but largely emotional. Modern man, insecure because he

# *The Problem of Generations*

no longer feels needed for his work contribution or for self-preservation (the automatic machines do things so much better and faster), is also insecure as a parent. He wonders how well he has discharged that other great function of man, the continuation of his species.

At this point modern youth becomes the dreaded avenging angel of his parents, since he holds the power to prove his parents' success or failure as parents; and this counts so much more now, since his parents' economic success is no longer so important in a society of abundance. Youth itself, feeling insecure because of its marginal position in a society that no longer depends on it for economic survival, is tempted to use the one power this reversal between the generations has conferred on it: to be accuser and judge of the parents' success or failure as parents.

How new is all this? It is very hard to compare one age with another. But the Alcibiades or Catiline of antiquity would not have had their followings if the problem of youth having to test itself against an older generation had not existed in those times; nor do Plato's indictments of what he saw as obstreperous youth sound very different from those leveled at our young people today. I may be the victim of those distortions of perspective that make things distant seem far smaller than those looming in the foreground.

Whether this is error in judgment or not, the fact remains that the present problems of Western youth in finding self-definition, and with it security, seem more complex than those of other generations. I say Western youth because, while Russia appears to have its equivalent of the Teddy boys and while Israel does not seem altogether happy with all aspects of Kibbutz-reared youth, the problems there seem different not only in quantity but also in quality. The main difference lies not so much in the particular tasks society sets for its younger generation but in how clearly the latter realize that only they, the generation of the future, can achieve these tasks.

This difference is critical, for, contrary to some people's opinion, youth does not create its own cause for which it is ready to fight. All it can do is to embrace causes developed by mature men. But youth can only do this successfully if the older men are satisfied with providing the ideals and do not also wish to lead the active battle for reaching them. Or, to put it differently, a youth expected to fight for his personal place in a society of well-defined direction is not lost but on his way. A youth expected to create a new but not yet delineated society finds himself a rebel without a cause. Only when

each group has its own important tasks, when one without the other cannot succeed, when age provides the direction but youth the leadership and the fighting manpower, is it clearly understood that whether the battle is won or lost depends on youth's fulfilling its all-important share of the total struggle.

As to who is to provide meaningful work for youth, I believe the answer is that nobody can do that for another. This is why I believe that the well-meant discussions and advice as to what industry should do to make factory work more meaningful has the problem all wrong. Nobody can make life or work more meaningful for others. Nor do most tasks have an absolute significance, not even the growing of food.

On our own plains, for example, stand acres of corn cribs filled to overflowing, while youth continues to leave rural America in droves. Yet its first response to the contemplated Peace Corps for underdeveloped areas was electric. This was the more striking since American farms are now largely mechanized (it is clean work), while the very goals of the Peace Corps include the mechanization of agriculture wherever it is still largely manual (which is "dirty" work). So it is not the work task (growing food) which attracts or repels youth, but the clear evidence that "they need you."

Yet when it became apparent that to join the Peace Corps candidates had to be screened, take examinations, and then be assigned tasks, enthusiasm faltered. It was not initially aroused by the chance to enter one more rat race of competitive examinations nor by the prospect of being sent where the managers of the Corps wanted them to go. They did not want to be emissaries, even of their country. They had jumped at the chance to go where they were needed and to prove how well they could do. They hoped to develop themselves while helping others to develop their country. When it became clear that they were expected to represent something else (in this case American goodwill abroad), they lost interest and, of the many who initially applied, few presented themselves for the scheduled examinations. A chance to act on their own fervor caused a stir; but faced with one more competition, they might as well continue the college rat race for suburbia.

True, a society of plenty can tempt people to waste their time by filling it with empty entertainment or meaningless comfort, or to strive for the wherewithal to do so. But no one need fall for this temptation nor can even the best TV programs make life more meaningful for viewers. At best they can provide the raw material which

# *The Problem of Generations*

the individual can then forge into a meaningful life.

Just as freedom and democracy cannot be handed down but have to be fought for, just as knowledge cannot be poured into the heads of our students but only situations created that induce them to seek it, so too industry cannot make work more meaningful for the worker. Only he can first find out what kind of work may be meaningful to him, and then go out and seek it, or at least a reasonable compromise between what is personally meaningful work and what jobs are available to him. I think those who complain that work is not more meaningful are in the wrong, too. What is wrong is that more people do not strive to find meaning in their lives; if they did, they would radically alter our economy and with it our working conditions.

Thus the older generation never has provided meaningful work or life for youth. All they have striven for was a deeper meaning in their own lives, and when they did that, segments of youth could at least follow their lead. It was the mature Marx, not the adolescent, who created Marxism, which then provided the basis for meaningful effort by a whole generation of youth. It was not the youthful but the mature Roosevelt who stimulated another generation of youth to find meaning in life through social improvement and through efforts to reorganize society.

Surely, we too give lip-service to the conviction that man's best hope is the next generation, but this hope does not seem very strong or attractive if we of the older generation do not pursue it with equal vigor. Neither our conviction that the West is declining nor our fear that atomic destruction will wipe man from the earth, realistic as each may well be, offers much hope for assertive self-realization, now or ever. If I cannot feel myself full of vitality because of my hopes for a life in the future, if the world I am about to create will not be better than that of my fathers, better not to live in this world, better to retire from it or feel alive in the moment, no matter what price I must pay in the future. So reasons the criminal delinquent who seeks a moment of heightened self-assertion in the anxious excitement of the criminal act, or through the kick he finds in his drugs.

As one delinquent youngster complained, "You can't live, if there's nothing to push against." What he meant is that you cannot test your own worth, your own strength and vitality, the very things you feel most dubious about as an adolescent, when all you can push against is a vacuum, or an adult society more than ready to give way, to act more youthful than even befits youth. Without

something definite to push against, youth feels lost. Many causes are embraced by youth, not for the cause itself, but because in fighting for it, its strength can be tested against something. Hence youth favors causes that run against the established order, even an ultra-conservative cause, because nothing is quite so safe a testing ground as the well-established order.

In Germany today, delinquent youth is often spoken of as the half strong (*die Halbstarken*). They are half strong because for them the older generation and its values mean the Hitler generation. But the ideas and values of those elders proved deficient in all important respects, while the generation of the fathers was cut down by heavy German losses during the war. Hence youth could not test itself against them and remained only half strong.

In the United States a very dissimilar but parallel process took place. The depression led to serious doubts about the values and ideas of the older generations as to the merits of a free enterprise society. The response of the older generation was frequently an inner abdication of the truly parental role. Since that generation felt it had embraced the false goddess of material success, they relinquished being mentors of the next generation and tried instead to be their pals, if not also their peers. They did not, however, give up wanting their children to give meaning to their own now emptier lives. While German fathers were either absent, or died in the war, or were morally destroyed by becoming Hitler's servants, many middle-class American parents simply abdicated their parental function but still wanted their parenthood proved successful by their children's achievements in life.

In terms of generations, then, the question that haunts every young person is: am I as good, as much a man as my father? as much a woman as my mother? This is something to measure up against, to find out if one has it in him to push things a bit further than the parents were able to do. But if the question has to be: am I as much a man as my father should have been, as my mother wants me to be? Or in reverse, and hence even more void of direction, the anxious question: am I the girl my father does not want me to be? Then the person is lost, without guideposts in his struggle to find out what kind of person he is and what kind of a person he wishes to be, as compared with the generation of his parents.

Where is youth to go? How is it to shape itself and its relation to the older generation, the image it must either want to emulate or to supersede with a better one? If I am not mistaken, it is in Jack

Kerouac's *On the Road* that two beat characters have the following conversation: "We got to go and never stop till we get there," says the first. The other wonders, "Where are we going, man?" and the answer is, "I don't know, but we gotta go."

These two young men are not in flight from society. They seek a goal—that much is clear. Otherwise, the first would not say they must go until they get there, nor would the second ask where they are going. If they were merely in flight, the first might have said they must go and never stop, and the question of destination would not have come up. More than that, they are in a great hurry to get started toward their goal; but this goal is elusive, and so they are people lost in their search, so lost that they no longer know which direction to take. Worse, they doubt that there is any direction. Therefore, their search for only an unknown goal becomes empty roaming. As long as they are on their way, they feel alive. If they stop, they fear to die. Therefore, any and all kinds of spurious activities will do, to keep from recognizing how lost they are.

Why is this goal eluding modern young man in search of himself? If manhood, if the good life in the good community, is the goal of adolescence, then the goal is clear, and with it the direction and the path. But what if existing manhood is viewed as empty, static, obsolescent? Then becoming a man is death, and manhood marks the death of adolescence, not its fulfillment. The bouyancy of youth is fed by the conviction of a full life to come, one in which all great things are theoretically attainable. But one cannot believe in the good life to come when the goal is suburbia. One cannot realize one's values by climbing the ladder of the business community, nor prove one's manhood on the greens of the country club; neither can one settle into security in an insecure world.

If there is no certainty of fulfillment, then it is better not to give up the promise of youth with its uncertainty, its lack of definite commitment. Youth at least offers a chance to escape the premature death of rigidity or the anxious confusion of a life that is disgraceful when it is without direction. Neither rigidity nor a confused running in many directions at once (and running after status or money are only the worst among nondirections) is an attractive goal for the young man trying to emerge from his state of uncommittedness into one of inner stability. Better to be committed to such uncommittedness than to commit oneself to spending the rest of one's life as a hollow man.

One's fathers (at least, the best of them) did a good job of

showing the young how hollow a life they had built. Let this be a warning not to join them in the waste lands. Better not to enter this land of walking shadows, of immaturity posing as maturity. Better to assert defensively one's uncommitted immaturity, one's remaining poised at the threshold of a life one does not wish to enter. It is the romantic position, but alas, the position of a generation which has little belief in the romance of a better world, a generation whose dreams are not to be striven for but subjected to analysis.

I have said that the present difficulties of youth are related to changed economic and social conditions, and to how much harder it has grown for youth to find its fulfillment in work. In this respect the fate of the girl can be even harder than the boy's. It is impressed on her from an early age that her main fulfillment will come with marriage and children, but her education has nevertheless been the same as that of boys, who are expected to realize themselves mainly through work and achievement in society. To make matters worse, the years in college or even graduate school have further prepared the female elite to seek self-realization in work, while society at large continues to stress that they must find it in motherhood.

Only very occasionally, for boys, is fatherhood added like an afterthought as part of their self-image as mature men. And nowhere, to the best of my knowledge, or only most incidentally, is the complementary image of being a husband even dimly outlined. Yet it should be obvious that women will not find fulfillment in being wives if their partners do not see being a husband as essential to their own self-realization.

True, not long ago there was a time when work around the house was hard, and it could and did proceed in conjunction with raising children and creating a home. But if modern labor-saving devices are relieving women of the most backbreaking work, they have also done away with the satisfactions it yielded. For girls, too, if machines do it better and faster, it is hard to grow up if there's not enough woman's work to be done. Buying ready-to-wear clothes for her family is a vicarious act. It reflects only her husband's ability to provide the money to buy them, but no unique or essential labors of her own. Since the same is nearly as true for cooking and the home arts, what remain, apart from child-rearing, are the most stultifying tasks—dusting, making beds, washing dishes. And beyond that lie mainly the refinements of homemaking, or what Veblen termed an occupation of ceremonial futility.

Many of the young woman's free-time activities are equally futile. I do not refer only to gardening, which replaces the conspicuous embroidery of an earlier age, or to the bridge circle or country-club life designed to help her husband toward his own type of ceremonial futility. I refer also to much that passes, unexamined, as more valuable pastimes, such as the PTA or the League of Women Voters. When used to cover up a vacuum of truly significant activities, of serious involvement, even these lose the genuine satisfactions they could otherwise confer. For, as Veblen also observed, "Woman is endowed with her share—which there is reason to believe is more than an even share—of the instinct of workmanship, to which futility of life or of expenditure is obnoxious," and such an impulse, when denied expression, leaves them "touched with a sense of grievance too vivid to leave them at rest."

But if a girl tries to fulfill her instinct for workmanship, she is subject to pressures not directed at boys. Many young men show little interest in marriage, even through their early thirties, and are allowed to go their way. At worst, a man may come in for gentle nagging at home, and his friends may tease him about it; but in the final analysis they accept his wish to postpone getting married and founding a family; they tacitly acknowledge that he is not ready yet, that he needs more time to find himself in his work life before he can settle down to family life. Such men are often popular, both in married and unmarried circles, and feel no adverse effect on their sense of accomplishment. In brief, a man is considered a failure if he does not support himself, does not achieve in work, but his marital status little affects people's estimate of him.

All this is very different for the girl. A woman, no matter how gifted or successful in her work life, is judged a failure if she does not marry fairly soon. From adolescence on, therefore, the pressure to marry interferes with her ability to find self-realization in her own personal way. Discrimination usually begins in youth, when there is some indulgence for the boy's nonconformity or revolt because he must "sow his wild oats"; much less tolerance is accorded the girl who seeks to find herself through such a period of nonconformity.

Many a college boy goes through a crisis of identity during his first years away from home, after exposure to many new ideas. Later, in his last years at college, he may suddenly throw himself into his studies, trying to find new identity in his work achievement. Many a girl finds herself in a parallel position; but then she suddenly realizes that with her new dedication to hard work and study, she

is failing to compete in the marriage market. Knowing that she wants to have a family one day, and fearing that with her present single-minded absorption it may slip through her fingers, she stops herself dead in her tracks; or worse, she cannot make up her mind which she really wants, and may lose out on both means of self-realization, if marriage has become the only possibility.

Nor is it only the college girl who suddenly kills her excitement about biochemistry because she realizes she is passing up desirable dates. The noncollege girl goes through a similar experience. She too is caught in the realization that society insists she can only find self-realization through an early marriage. So she gives up her tentative new interests as impractical and buckles down to a course in beauty culture or secretarial work. Later, as the young wife of a skilled or unskilled worker, she is exactly as restless and bewildered as the college girl who gave up biochemistry to achieve married life in the suburbs. Neither girl can understand why, though now a success in the eyes of others, all the meaning of life is evading her. This meaning she now looks for in the task of bringing her children up right, which means finding vicarious satisfaction in their lives, with all the consequences discussed earlier.

Here the worker's wife is perhaps the worst off, because she lacks even the secondary gains of her suburban counterpart. Many such women, uprooted too often, no longer try to fill their emptiness with family gossip or church activities, but try to find, if not meaning, at least some escape from emptiness through a job. Unfortunately, it is rarely the kind of work that gives meaning to their lives; but at least it provides association with equals and is preferred to the drudgery of homemaking.

Yet it is not only the instinct for workmanship which is too often frustrated in the modern young woman; frequently it is also her sexual instinct. While sexual difficulties are neither a recent curse of youth, nor restricted to one sex alone, the American attitude toward sex and the educational system have here, too, burdened female youth more than male youth.

Early in this article I referred to the puberty rites of preliterate societies. These elaborate rituals mark the reaching of sexual maturity and assure the initiates of their new adult status. In most of these societies sex was never at all secret nor was pregenital sex experience forbidden. The child learned what sex was all about as he grew up, watching older persons and animals in intercourse. In

farming societies, the fecundity of animals is always a central economic issue, so if adult sex is no longer open, at least animal procreation in all its ramifications is still freely observed and discussed in most parts of the world.

Not so in American middle-class society; and what observations are available to the growing child are shrouded in secrecy, if not in embarrassment or outright shame. We all know that shame and embarrassment about the normal bodily functions make sex experiences difficult for much of modern youth. But compensatory efforts to make of sex relations more than they can ever be are equally confounding. I am speaking of the many literary descriptions of intercourse as an earth-shaking event (for example, Hemingway's description in *For Whom the Bell Tolls*). Obviously, one's own sexual experiences, however rewarding, have no such cosmic effect and hence do not seem to come up to par.<sup>8</sup>

Laurence Wylie (p. 203 below) describes how, in a large segment of the French middle classes, the adolescent boy receives his training in love-making from an older woman and then in turn initiates a girl younger than himself in the art he has learned. There is much more than simple experience involved in this way of teaching sex to an inexperienced young man. His very inexperience makes him attractive to the mature woman. In the typical American pattern, ignorance is supposed to be the best teacher of the ignorant in sexual matters. But here the young man's inexperience makes him feel clumsy and insecure in seducing his girl, who, as likely as not, had to seduce him into becoming the seducer in the first place.

American middle-class youth learns about sex in the back seat of a car, or during a slightly drunken party, or because there was nothing better to do to kill boredom (read: sexual frustration and anxiety). The first sexual experience often leaves ineffaceable impressions, marred by a total lack of experience on either side. Both partners feeling anxious and insecure, neither one can offer encouragement to the other, nor can they take comfort from the accomplished sex act, since they cannot be sure that they did it well, all comparisons lacking.

To use Wylie's example again, the young Frenchman not only knows that his inexperience makes him sexually attractive, he also receives the accolade of the person from whom it counts most: an experienced woman has found him not only sexually attractive but from her rich experience (based on comparisons) she has also assured him that he is a manly lover indeed. Thus, secure in his mas-

culinity, he in due course will be sexually attracted by a young girl's inexperience, rather than frightened by it, as his American counterpart usually is. She, feeling that her innocence, or at least her inexperience, makes her attractive, will not feel clumsy because of it, and he, encouraged by previous experience, will feel himself well able to satisfy his girl sexually.<sup>9</sup> Feeling sure that he can satisfy her, she will feel she has satisfied him.

This, of course, is comparing a French "ideal" type of introduction to sex with an American "ideal" type. In actuality, there are as many variations in France as in the United States in the ways youth is introduced to sex. Still, the French way is as typical there as the other is of middle class youth in America. What goes far beyond a mere paradigm of sex behavior in the two countries is the way youth is prepared for the expected sexual role. In France, as in many other lands, both boy and girl from early childhood on are prepared, the first to take the more dominant, the other the more yielding role, not only in sex but also in the family.

In earlier times there have been societies, or at least subsocieties, in which the woman was dominant in the home and even in intimate relations. This situation may still be found in certain segments of the French middle classes, and it used to be characteristic of some orthodox Jewish groups. It seems that successful family life can be organized on such a basis as long as the man's dominance in his sphere is clearly recognized and never challenged by women. The man's sphere is usually the work life, be it in the professions, in business, or politics.

In the orthodox Jewish groups referred to, the man's unquestioned superiority in the all-important religious sphere permitted both to accept gladly the wife's dominance in running the home and often also the shop. With the areas of dominance thus clearly marked out, the wife could be dominant in her sphere without extending it to running her husband's life or her children's. Though such a woman was dominant in the home, no "mom-ism" resulted. Secure in her sphere, it did not occur to her to challenge the man's. More importantly, she did not expect her husband to be dominant at home or in business. Therefore, she was not disappointed in what she expected of him, and hence she did not need to make up for it by nagging him or dominating her children.<sup>10</sup> The woman who engages in "mom-ism" and wishes to "wear the pants" does not act out of an original desire to go her husband one better, but in defense and retaliation.

Certainly, our educational system does not prepare the girl to play the more dominant role in the home sphere, nor the more surrendering role, either in sex or other areas of experience. Instead, she is raised in contradiction. On the one hand, she is told that to be feminine means to be yielding, to be courted, and that this is the desirable norm for a woman. She certainly cannot, for example, ask a boy for a date, nor pay the expenses of a date, though in some circles she may sometimes "go Dutch."<sup>11</sup>

Contrary to such passivity (waiting to be asked out), where it counts most emotionally, she is taught in school not only to think but also to act for herself. What she is not taught, either at home or in our educational system, is the emotional counterpart of the facts of life: that men and women are neither wholly equal nor by any means opposite sexes, but are complementary; that neither things that are equal nor those that are opposite can be complementary. More importantly, she is not taught wherein men and women are alike—in their talents, aspirations, and emotional needs—and where they are not. From her educationally reinforced but unexamined notion of an equality of the sexes, arise many of the girl's difficulties in her sex relations. For, without clearly understanding her own nature, she does not know where and when to be "feminine" and where and when to be "equal."<sup>12</sup>

For example, in societies in which technology has not yet affected the social conditions of women or their expectations, her sexual life is in far less conflict than in ours. It is still sufficient for her if her lover or husband enjoys sex with her. Since she feels that his enjoyment proves her a good woman, nothing stands in her way of enjoying herself; and, not worrying about whether she is frigid or has an orgasmic experience, as likely as not she experiences orgasm. He, not obliged by older tradition or by any newer understanding to provide her with an orgasmic experience, can enjoy himself, experience orgasm, and thus help her to experience it herself.

In our own society, the male youth needs as much as ever to have his virility attested by his sexual partner, and the female youth has a parallel need. But by now, the boy also needs to have his girl prove him a man by her so-called "orgastic experience," and the girl is even worse off. She not only has to prove him a man by making him experience orgasm; she must also prove her femininity by the same experience, because otherwise she must fear she is frigid. Sexual intercourse cannot often stand up to such complex emotional demands of proving so many things in addition to being enjoyable.

To compound it all, the girl has grown conditioned by all her previous experience in school and college to performing with males on equal grounds, but not on how to complement them.<sup>13</sup> She cannot suddenly learn this in bed. She, trying to make sure that the man has an orgastic experience, and also wondering if she will be able to have one herself, gets so worried that she can truly experience neither, and ends up pretending. In order to prove their manhood or womanhood, the act is now burdened by their having to prove their potency to themselves and to each other, if not also to make the earth shake. Sex becomes another competition of who can make whom have an orgastic experience, and they cannot give up their self-centered needs in the act. The result is that they are unable to enjoy either their mutual desire or the forgetting of self in the experience.

If sexual relations are often less than satisfactory, and if female youth has put work achievement behind her, what is left for the girl by way of self-realization? With home-making now less challenging or satisfying, the children become a concentrated target of the young woman's energies. Here at least, if she starts out feeling less experienced than her mother, she feels considerably more sophisticated. Her world is no longer, as in an older generation, confined to her children, her kitchen, and the church. For years, through the period of her schooling, and perhaps later in a professional occupation, she has worked hard to enlarge her horizon, intellectually and emotionally. Motherhood was depicted to her, and she looked forward to it, as another tremendous, enlarging experience. Yet in reality it forces her to give up most of her old interests, and, unless she is fascinated by the minute developments of the infant, no new and different enrichment is on the horizon. Thus the new world of experience fails to materialize just at the moment when the old enriching experiences are closed, because the infant demands her concentrated attention.

All this is particularly acute with the first child, because the second and third child provide additional content in the mother's life while she cares for the newcomer. I am convinced she will have to find a solution to this problem. It might mean creating something akin to the extended family, through which some societies solved the problem; this meant entrusting part of infant care to the older children or sharing it with relatives. Another solution would be the care of young children by professional people while the mother pursues her individual interests, at least, for part of her time.

In any case, the young mother is now doubly disadvantaged. She cannot find fulfillment in her wifely and motherly role, because she lacks a partner who can complement her in tasks that cannot be mastered alone, or at least not in an emotionally satisfying way. In addition, she is in conflict between her old traditional role and the new image of self-fulfillment through work to which all her schooling has directed her. Or, to put it differently, she is torn between the image of her vicarious role in society as mother and housewife and the self-directed image of herself that developed before marriage. Together, these conflicts are often enough to sour her on motherhood, which she could otherwise fully enjoy.

Resentful in many cases that her husband enjoys what to her seems a fuller life, she tries either to force him to share motherhood with her (which he cannot do without damage to his emotional well-being) or she expects marriage itself to compensate for the frustrated work aspects of her self-realization (which marriage cannot do). Hence she may also sour on her marriage.

The fact that female youth does not react in open conflict with a society that forces her into such an impossible predicament has to do with the actual and socially fostered difference between the sexes. The male delinquent will engage mainly in aggressive acts such as the destruction of property or other forms of aggressive violence; in the "beat," this may be turned inwards, as in the destructive neglect of his own body. In adolescence the female counterpart of violence is sex delinquency, which is less apt to bring the girl into conflict with society.

Yet again this behavior is more often socially imposed than biologically inherent. Many girls who feel "unfeminine" in terms of Hollywood fostered attitudes become sex delinquents to prove they are feminine, or at least to deny that they are not. The nondelinquent, more adult female youth may take things out on her husband and children in less obvious but equally destructive nagging, in a general dissatisfaction that drives her husband to try to achieve for her what only she can achieve for herself.

Others have come to recognize that the problem is largely theirs and are groping for reasonable solutions. Like Negro youth in America, they find themselves a minority with certain psychological advantages. If the majority of young American males can choose their occupations freely but long for more purpose to their labors, the minorities among youth are still fighting with a purpose. Once they do achieve the freedom to pursue self-chosen goals, then the

current problems of youth will be no different for boys than for girls, white or Negro.

The elections of 1960 brought an upsurge of purpose, at least in a segment of our population who felt that the new administration had a place for their aspirations, might give them scope to create a better world. This was true for both youth and adult, but youth would not have believed it, if their elders had not shown that their hopes seemed to be justified. As one colleague of mine put it while observing changes on the campus of his university: These students who for years have been rebels without a cause were for the most part too sensible even to rebel. But when they first started to work for Stevenson, and then for Kennedy, and ever since the latter's election, they became dedicated workers for a better future. Yet these, as I say, were only a small segment. The vast majority of the young, like the vast majority of the old, still lacking a direction, seek harder than ever for an empty comfort. This, they hope, may enable them to forget that they have no purpose beyond it, and, as it fails, their search for more of the same becomes increasingly frantic and empty.

Many visitors to Russia, and not only educators, have been struck by how well-behaved Russian children are to their parents, and their parents to them. This mutual respect is entirely different in texture from either fear or the uneasy camaraderie sought by so many parents in our society, where the parent sees his task as that of play companion rather than mentor to the young. Perhaps the explanation lies in what Russian educators have to say about this remarkable difference. They claim that "the good behavior of the children is the result of the clarity and agreement on the part of all teachers [and all adults, we might add] as to their expectations from the children," expectations based on a strong sense of common purpose to create a better social system than has ever existed.<sup>14</sup> Now these for the most part are the children of the people who are still trying to create a new and better society for all, and not of the ruling elite, who already enjoy most of the new advantages. That is why "delinquent" tendencies are found more readily among children of the elite.

Yet even the common purpose of creating a better world, while assuring youth its importance in creating it, is not enough in itself to permit all who seek it to realize themselves. There must be added the clear conception of the usefulness of one's labor; and even then there will always be some who must travel an individual pathway

not provided by society, for testing their manhood and worth.

Modern American society has virtually cut off such avenues inside the framework of that society. (Some young people seek them in foreign countries; witness the past attraction of the Spanish Civil War and the current appeal of the Cuban upheaval and of the new African countries.) No longer is there an open frontier for escape from the oppressive feeling that one cannot prove oneself within a rigidly stratified society. Where is a modern Ishmael to roam? Though he may feel like "methodically knocking off people's hats," he cannot run away to sea because life there is now as regulated and devoid of chances for self-realization as on land. Prevented from knocking people's hats off, or hauled into court or to the psychiatrist for trying to, he feels he has no "substitute for pistol and ball," and may end up using them.

I have said before that for youth to come into his own means to a large degree his replacing the older generation, and that, whether the transition is smooth or hard-won, youth is still on its way. Thus the problem of the generations, when it goes wrong, may be characterized by saying that, whenever the older generation has lost its bearings, the younger generation is lost with it. The positive alternatives of emulation or revolt are then replaced by the lost quality of neither.

And this, I am afraid, is the situation in which large segments of American youth find themselves. They are unhappy when they settle down to continue in a pattern of life that their parents have arranged for them, because they know it to be an empty one. But they find it pointless to rebel, as do those others who, sensing emptiness in the lives prepared for them, fight against it but do not know what to fight for.

Old age is happiest when it can take youth up to the threshold of the good and the new and, like the mythical father of the West, point out the Promised Land to its children, saying: you and only you in a hard fight will have to make this your own; because what is handed down to you, what you have not won for yourselves, is never truly your own.

Youth, on the other hand, is happiest when it feels it is fighting to reach goals that were conceived of but not realized by the generation before them. What the older generation then urgently wished for itself, but had to acknowledge as the hope of the future—this is the legacy of youth. That the preceding generation wished to create

such a better world makes it a worthy standard for youth. To come closer to achieving it through its own efforts proves to youth that it is gaining its own rich maturity.

the German occupation of France and the bombing of Hiroshima. If the earth has to shake or world history to look on before a love affair can be meaningful for the partners, youth must find itself in awkward straits in its love relations.

2. Things changed when such families left the ghettos and entered modern technological societies. Once the religious sphere lost in importance, while the work sphere grew tremendously important, there were commensurate upheavals in the balance within the family.
3. I can only mention in passing what would call for lengthy discussion: how a society of relative abundance has changed the dating and mating patterns. In other societies it was well known that the greatest attention one could show the courted person was to devote time and attention to him or her. In our society, in which the phrase "time is money" is more than a slogan, money must often make up for time; a boy's car or the money he can spend on his date now replaces the time and attention spent in being with her.

It is not simply that money is made to make up for emotional dedication, which it can never do; it is also made to prove virility, if not even orgasmic potency, for which it is equally unsuitable. Many men who doubt their masculinity and virility try to quiet their fears through their social or economic success. Falsely equating virility with beating the other guy in competition, they must come out on top at all costs. But when success is sought not for itself but to make up for something that is missing, it cannot even be enjoyed for what it is, since it cannot make up for what it is not.

The counterpart of such a situation is found in a wife who feels thwarted in her hope for a virile man who can truly make her feel and be a woman. Heedlessly, she spends his money and eggs him on to achieve further status, since these have to make up to her for what they never can, her empty feeling of being a failure as a woman.

But all this comes later in life. It is not yet a problem of youth unless they have been exposed to it in their parents. Similarly, they cannot take their teachers as images to copy, if teachers in their sphere strive for academic success much as members of the business community use money and the status it confers.

1. There is a corresponding confusion in the way we look upon initiative in women, for not all "active" women are unfeminine. Women who strive to "wear the pants" do so for defensive and neurotic reasons, just as the very need to be dominant, whether in man or in woman, is due to thwarted desires, if not also to a thwarted personality. Quite different is the striving to achieve for a purpose, for, like men, some women strive to realize their inner potentials—quite outside any context of competing with other men, other women, or any standard of measurement except their own wish to work toward a purpose. Until we distinguish clearly between the two, we

shall continue to hold back, by labeling “unfeminine,” those girls who seek to further their own natural growth and development.

13. Things would not be so bad if the competition were only with persons. To compete with somebody one knows well keeps competition in the human dimension and leads to personal jealousies, hopes and disappointments. But much of the competition where it counts most (merit scholarships, college boards) involves not just a person but rather competing with one's whole age group. It is a competitiveness in the abstract, not against another person, but for a score on a test. As if this were not bad enough, competitions other than for grades and scholastic achievement have entered our educational system. All too often, at the same “educational” place where youngsters compete for grades, they are also competing for dates and a marriage partner.
