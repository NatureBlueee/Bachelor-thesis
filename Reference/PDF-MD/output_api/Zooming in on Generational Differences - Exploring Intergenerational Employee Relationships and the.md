## Abstract

As generation Z (Gen Z) enters the workforce, there is growing interest in the dynamics of intergenerational collaboration within diverse workplaces. This study investigates how stereotypes and meta-stereotypes regarding Gen Z affect their interactions with colleagues from other generations—baby boomers, generation X, and millennials—and vice versa. Drawing upon social cognitive theory as a framework, this scholarship explores the perceptions and behaviors of employees across four generations through a qualitative approach, involving in-depth interviews with 30 participants from various generational cohorts. Findings reveal generational differences in workplace values, the benefits of cross-generational collaboration, and strategies for accommodating intergenerational communication. Despite negative stereotypes, such as perceived laziness, Gen Z employees are recognized for their technological adeptness and eagerness to learn, highlighting the importance of mentorship and knowledge sharing. The results emphasize the necessity of flexible communication strategies and proactive relationship building to enhance teamwork and mitigate misunderstandings across generational divides. This study contributes to the limited empirical research on Gen Z in the workplace and offers practical implications for fostering inclusive organizational cultures that leverage generational diversity. Future research directions are suggested to further explore the evolution of intergenerational dynamics in the workplace.

Interest in how individuals from different generations collaborate with each other in the work environment has grown steadily, particularly as members of Gen Z begin to enter the workforce. There have been studies on leader-member intergenerational conflict (Zhu et al., 2016), tips for managers leading intergenerational staff (Guérin-Maron et al., 2018), and investigations into how workgroup and organizational cultures are changing (or expected to) with the integration of Gen Z (Racoltá-Paina & Irini, 2021). While the addition of any new generation into the workplace likely means changes to the status quo, the experiences and perceptions of members of Gen Z have been trending particularly negatively. The current research argues that investigating intergenerational workgroup dynamics—particularly in regard to stereotypes and meta-stereotypes—is essential as previous research has not addressed the negative perceptions surrounding Gen Z as well as their perceptions of colleagues from other generations.

A recent survey found that three out of four of managers and business leaders find Gen Z more difficult to work with than other generations (Resume Builder, 2024), with the same survey finding that nearly 65% of respondents report having to fire members of this generation more commonly than employees in any other generation. Noted periodicals such as Forbes, BBC, The Washington Post, and Newsweek have all published recent articles related to Gen Z in the workplace, with titles ranging from “Gen Z is Toxic for Companies, Employers Believe” (Blake, 2024) to “Gen Z workers can take criticism. You’re just phrasing it wrong” (Abril, 2024). Academic and business leaders, such as Stanford and Deloitte, have also conducted surveys and offered guidance related to this cohort and what their presence may mean for team and organizational functioning. With a variety of generations in the workplace comes a mix of relationship, task, and communication styles which may not always work well with others—particularly across age groups. In addition to actual differences, such as generational colloquialisms, that may present as employees from different generations work together, perceptions of other generations may influence employees’ behaviors as well.

Assumptions or oversimplified beliefs, also known as stereotypes, created about individuals from different generations can impact how people in intergenerational workplaces collaborate with each other (Barhate & Dirani, 2021). Stereotypes can also lead to misunderstandings, conflict, and communication breakdown (Baker Rosa & Hastings, 2018). When older generations view Gen Z through a negative lens, it impacts their interactions and can lead to behaviors that reinforce these stereotypes. For example, if baby boomers perceive Gen Z employees as lazy, they may be less inclined to invest in their development or mentorship, ultimately stifling opportunities for both parties and impacting workplace dynamics.

Meta-stereotypes—beliefs individuals hold about how their generation is perceived by others—can also significantly influence workplace behavior (Finkelstein et al., 2015). Recent research (King et al., 2022) has illustrated that meta-stereotypes can impede how someone operates in their daily interactions with coworkers, and these negative perceptions surrounding Gen Z can lead to identity management challenges as our newest generation attempts to navigate a work environment that may not fully accept or understand their unique attributes.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2030 there will be approximately 50 million Gen Z employees in the workplace, yet there's still a surprising lack of empirical studies focusing on the newest group in the workforce: Gen Z (Mann, 2022). Moreover, many individuals from Gen Z experienced delayed graduation and canceled internships as a result of COVID (USAFACTS, 2024), resulting in slower entry into the workforce. Coupled with a significant decrease in hiring of entry-level opportunities (Koc, 2021), Gen Z's entry to the workforce has been slower and more prolonged than previous generations. Thus, using social cognitive theory (Schunk & Usher, 2012) as the main framework, the purpose of this research is to investigate how baby boomers, generation X, millennials, and Gen Z employees perceive stereotypes and meta-stereotypes related to their cohort and others' may negatively impact how they work with those from different generations. This study also explores if and how employees are able to identify generational differences in the workplace as a potential benefit to them.

The literature review examines intergenerational employees' impacts of stereotypes and meta-stereotypes in the workplace through a social cognitive theory lens. Then, a robust qualitative study is presented which entails in-depth interviews with individuals from the four generations in the workplace setting (baby boomers, generation X, millennials, and Gen Z). The discussion connects the findings with extant scholarly literature, leaving pragmatic and theoretical implications for both academics and practitioners.

## Literature Review

Intergenerational employees are individuals from different generations, or age cohorts, who also all work together (Burmeister et al., 2021). Ngotngamwong (2019) suggests there are currently up to four generations in the workplace, from baby boomers to Gen Z. With such a dynamic workforce of ages, intergenerational knowledge has become a valuable and much needed asset for skill building and knowledge retention (Ropes, 2011). For example, Starks (2013) found benefits regarding job efficiency and planning proficiency for someone's employment future, such as promotions, when intergenerational employees collaborated (Starks, 2013). Relatedly, Baran and Klos (2014) argued that generational diversity is a competitive strength that can lead to new and enhanced competencies when organizations facilitate learning among and between age cohorts. Others (Malik & Shahid, 2024) continue to echo that when organizational structures are in place, intergenerational workgroups stand to outperform others due to the opportunities for mentoring and knowledge sharing. However, not all research on intergenerational workplaces is positive.

Generations tend to differ on important dimensions such as work attitudes, values, impact and use of technology, communication styles, and commitment to employers (Singh et al., 2021). Considering the importance of these foundational dimensions of work, it is of little surprise some challenges can arise as a result of working together. For example, a previous study (Jelenko, 2020) identified intergenerational differences can have a direct negative impact on job satisfaction and an indirect negative impact on employee engagement. The research shows perceived age discrimination has both a greater direct impact on job satisfaction among older employees and a greater indirect impact on older employees' engagement than on younger employees' job satisfaction and engagement (Jelenko, 2020). This previous research indicates the significant intergenerational differences, and/or similarities, related to the employee experience. To further understand intergenerational employees and who they are, it is crucial to take a closer look at what generations currently exist in the workplace in the United States.

### Baby Boomers

Baby boomers are the oldest generation in the workplace, where these individuals were born between the years of 1943 and 1960 (Appelbaum et al., 2004). It is projected by the year 2030 that over 20% of the United States will be 65 years or older, all of whom will be the last of the baby boomers (Dong et al., 2017). Eighty percent of baby boomers have expressed their dissatisfaction with current events in the United States and 21% have stated their standard of living is hardly near the standard of living their parents had at their age, indicating there is a sense of decline or dissatisfaction with their current living and working conditions compared to those of their parents (Hogan et al., 2008). Baby boomers also have a reputation of not having the best knowledge and experience navigating technology, with a 2015 study (Bennett-Kapusniak, 2015) revealing that baby boomers lack technological system knowledge which inhibits them from using technology to research and/or share information such as photographs with family and/or friends. This is one of the many differences they share with the next age cohort, generation X.

### Generation X

Generation X are individuals who were born between the years of 1965 and 1980 (Whitehouse & Flippin, 2017). These individuals are known to be comfortable with authority in the workplace while also having a sense of the importance of a work/life balance (Dolot, 2018). Due to witnessing their baby boomer parents being laid off from work, this generation embraces and understands change, leading them to be more independent of employees compared to boomers (Wiedmer, 2015). Even with their acknowledgement and comfortableness of authority, generation Xers have learned to be aggressive communicators as they pursue recognition in the workplace while also respecting their elders, the baby boomers (Kolnhofer-Derecskei et al., 2017). This generation is viewed as experienced workers who may have a position in upper

management, or at least, someone who is part of important decision-making processes at their place of employment (Cheah et al., 2016). One of the primary distinctions between this generation and the next, millennials, is that the younger cohort has long been criticized for expecting a near immediate place at the decision-making table (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010).

### Millennials

Millennials are individuals born between the years of 1980 and 1995 (Ng & Johnson, 2015). There is support that millennial employees hold different values and expectations compared to other generations, such as working toward high materialistic rewards and prefer recreation and leisure time over their time at work (Lyons & Kuron, 2014). Millennials have been known to switch careers more often than other generations, as they seek to find work which is meaningful and engaging to them (Ng & Johnson, 2015). Much research has been done comparing millennials to other generations, specifically baby boomers. For example, a study found that millennials have lower attitudes toward helping others in the workplace as compared to baby boomers (Twenge et al., 2010). Additional research on millennials is thought to be more motivated by work that leads to a more sustainable world rather than being motivated by a paycheck alone (Deloitte, 2016).

### Gen Z

Gen Z describes individuals born between the years of 1995 and 2012 (Gabrielova & Buchko, 2021). There is not as much research on this generation (Mann, 2022) compared to others since the oldest of the cohort have recently begun full-time work. What we do know about this generation is that relationships are vital as they thrive on having well established connections and interactions with colleagues and see a supportive workplace as one that is “tight-knit” (Barhate & Dirani, 2021). However, a recent study with managers and business leaders indicated that nearly 50% of the sample noted that it is difficult to work with Gen Z all or most of the time (Resume Builder, 2024). With Gen Z entering the workforce, there is a gap between their current situation (coming from an educational institution, whether that is college or high school) and their aspirations in the workforce. Some have also noted an underdeveloped interpersonal and cognitive abilities, such as leadership skills, with Gen Z, but this could be contributed from intergenerational differences and communication issues between Gen Z and other generations (Jensen, 2021).

The current workforce landscape is shaped by four distinct generations, each with unique perspectives. Baby boomers, being the oldest demographic group in the workplace, express dissatisfaction with current events and struggle with technology adoption. Generation X, who value work-life balance, adaptability, and assertive communication often hold positions in upper management and are comfortable with authority. Millennials, who prioritize meaningful work and leisure time are often perceived as self-centered. Lastly, Gen Z, who prioritize relationships and seek a

supportive, tight-knit workplace environment, enter the workforce with aspirations but also with likely gaps in leadership skills and communication.

Though research on intergenerational workplace outcomes is fairly expansive there remains a notable gap which focuses on Gen Z and their interactions with other generations. As we explore the dynamics of intergenerational employees in the workplace, it is important to turn our attention toward how stereotypes and meta-stereotypes significantly shape interactions and understanding across diverse age groups.

### *Stereotypes and Meta-Stereotypes*

A stereotype is a widely held and oversimplified belief or idea about a particular group of individuals (Baker Rosa & Hastings, 2018). These are often based on assumptions or generalizations and may not accurately represent the individuals in the group which they come from (Beukeboom & Burgers, 2019). Meta-stereotypes refer to the beliefs people have about the stereotypes other people hold about their own social group (Peters et al., 2019). Research on both of these topics tends to be negative. For example, a study aimed to uncover whether the identification of age differences in the workplace impact job satisfaction and employee engagement (Jelenko, 2020). The participants of the study were asked to recall perceptions they have about others they work with as well as their meta-stereotypes. Unfortunately, the results of the study suggest there is a direct negative influence of intergenerational differentiation through age discrimination and job satisfaction. More recently (Arras-Djabi et al., 2024) another study further examined the implication of stigmas, which are manifested as negative stereotypes, perceptions, or discrimination against a group of people (Andersen et al., 2022), when it comes to the interactions between frontline workers and customers. The study indicated that stereotypes can do more than hurt feelings, but rather can have additional tangible effects in that stigmas can negatively influence frontline workers' compensation (Arras-Djabi et al., 2024).

Stereotypes can be seen as a shared language among individuals in a shared generation (Beukeboom & Burgers, 2019). This finding is exemplified by leading social scientists conducting work that resulted in the iGen Language Project hosted by the University of Oxford. The iGen Language Project is part of the larger Dictionary Lab with the University of Oxford dedicated to preserving and studying language. Industry leader Edelman built a Gen Z Lab to bridge the gap between marketers and Gen Z, largely owing to the unique communication characteristics of the generation. Thus, while members of Gen Z intuitively understand others in their age cohort, their shared language usage is less accessible to members of other generations. In another study, Mann (2022) found stereotypes can be viewed as dangerous as they wield the power to make others believe in certain characteristics about a group of people without having any proof to support these beliefs. Similarly, researchers discovered that individuals tend to associate physical features—such as the ubiquitous use of headphones and connection to technology—with particular social groups, and these associations influenced their perceptions of those groups (Dasgupta et al., 1999; Stanford Report, 2024).

Meta-stereotypes help individuals identify qualities other people may have about their age group. This can also cause individuals to worry deeply about what others

think about them or people they believe to be like them (King et al., 2022). These concerns are not unfounded, as a recent study (Peters et al., 2019) found that strong negative meta-stereotypes between age and four dimensions of employability—occupational expertise, corporate sense, personal flexibility, and anticipation and optimization—can significantly limit older adults' perceived value in the workplace. Age group membership and negative age-based (meta-)stereotypes reduce employability, directly impacting career options and shaping career decisions (Finkelstein et al., 2015).

To recap, stereotypes and meta-stereotypes are perceptions individuals hold about groups. Stereotypes describe generalized ideas held about outside groups or individuals, whereas meta-stereotypes detail the perceptions we hold regarding stereotypes about our own group. The challenge with both stereotypes and meta-stereotypes is that both tend to skew negative, which is especially concerning considering that today's workforce is the most generationalally diverse in history. A related concern that stems from stereotypes and meta-stereotypes is that even though these ideas are often rooted in perception rather than practice, they impact individuals' behaviors which can lead to additional challenges since much organizational learning occurs through observing and modeling behavior (Bandura, 1986).

### *Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)*

Social cognitive theory (SCT; Bandura, 1986) examines how individuals develop and sustain behaviors, acknowledging both their distinctive learning processes and the social context in which these behaviors occur (LaMorte, 2022). For example, Bandura (1986, 1999) suggested that employees learn from observing others such as taking stock of how peers interact with the manager and making note of the outcome. In other words, does a peer receive more optimal outcomes (i.e., praise, mentoring, and guidance) when asking for direct, specific feedback regarding a project, or when they pose broad questions and allow the manager to color the response? In addition to observing and modeling behavior, SCT indicates that individuals learn more quickly when certain behaviors are reinforced—both positively and or negatively—and when the individual feels capable, or has the self-efficacy, to enact the normative behaviors within a group (Arendt, 2024). The influence of the group goes a long way in shaping individual behavior, which may feel particularly challenging for generations who have adapted to working collaboratively and for members of Gen Z who are tacitly expected to comply with group norms though finding them counterintuitive.

In intergenerational workplaces, coworkers may model their behaviors based on their perceptions of how others from their own or other generations behave, including conforming to or challenging stereotypes and meta-stereotypes. SCT helps us break down how behaviors are learned and adopted, yielding a framework to understand why stereotypes and meta-stereotypes have a large impact on intergenerational employees (Lagacé et al., 2019). Tang and Martins (2021) employed SCT in a study with an intergenerational workplace and found that the best route to encourage knowledge sharing between generations was via human resources strategies. This indicates that communication and or exchange across generations may not necessarily come naturally without encouragement or reinforcement (Bandura, 1999).

Figure 1 is a visual representation of the relationship between SCT pillars, stereotypes, meta-stereotypes, and workplace communication. The diagram shows nested boxes:

- **Stereotypes & Meta-stereotypes** (Outermost box) is associated with:
  - Stereotypes = assumptions or generalizations individuals make about others based on group membership.
  - Meta-stereotypes = how individuals believe others perceive them based on their own group identity. Stereotypes and meta-stereotypes lay the foundation for shaping workplace experiences.
- **Workplace Attitudes** (Middle box) is associated with:
  - Workplace Attitudes = encompass job satisfaction, sense of belonging, and perceived inclusion or exclusion.
  - Directly impact communication, potentially leading to self-censorship, code-switching, or assertive interactions.
- **Communication Styles** (Innermost box) is associated with:
  - Communication Styles = how individuals express themselves, interact with colleagues, and navigate workplace discourse.

**Figure 1.** Visual representation of the relationship between SCT pillars, stereotypes, meta-stereotypes, and workplace communication.

Within a workplace setting, biased perceptions regarding intergenerational stereotypes can influence an employer's decisions about staff management and employees' discriminatory behavior toward one another, such as in collaboration (Tanveer et al., 2020). Tanveer et al. (2020) found that beliefs about the traits of different generations—perceptions, rather than facts—stem from two factors: (1) the content and influence of others' beliefs about a particular generation, and (2) how individuals from certain generations perceive what members of other generations think of them. Together, this research highlights the impact of both stereotypes and meta-stereotypes (Figure 1).

In summary, SCT tells us that we look to others for cues on how to think and act in various situations (Bandura, 1986). Yet, this can become problematic when there are challenges in communicating with others due to how we perceive the group (i.e., stereotypes). That is, a stereotype of Gen Z as lazy, entitled, or disrespectful (Stanford Report, 2024) is likely to influence how a seasoned employee approaches their interactions with and expectations of their new colleague. In the same vein, if the Gen Z employee perceives that their colleagues see them in a negative light, it is likely to shape the way in which they interact with their team. Yet, since Gen Z has just recently begun to enter the workplace, their experience and impact remain relatively unknown. To that end, the following research questions are forwarded:

**RQ1:** How do stereotypes influence workplace dynamics?

**RQ2:** How do stereotypes influence communication styles across generations?

**RQ3:** How do meta-stereotypes influence each generation's perceptions of themselves?

**RQ4:** How do meta-stereotypes influence each generation's interactions with other generations?

**RQ5:** What strategies do employees use to foster working relationships with individuals from different generations?

## Materials and Methods

For this research there is an investigation into the intricacies of intergenerational workplace employees, primarily Gen Z individuals, and the way stereotypes and meta stereotypes play a part in the perceptions of themselves and other colleagues. To consider both stereotypes and meta-stereotypes, participants were sampled from the four generations currently in the workforce.

### Participants

Participants of this study include individuals representing the four different generations mentioned in this research: baby boomers, generation X, millennials, and Gen Z. To be eligible to participate in this study, all individuals needed to have prior or current work experience and be over the age of 18 years old. Participants were recruited through a combination of social media posts and the snowball method.

The sample consisted of 30 individuals including: 5 baby boomers ( $M=64.5$  years,  $SD=4.12$ ), 8 members from generation X ( $M=46.63$  years,  $SD=3.70$ ), 8 millennials ( $M=32.2$  years,  $SD=3.85$ ), and 9 members from Gen Z ( $M=22.5$  years,  $SD=2.45$ ). The decision to conduct 30 interviews was guided by the principle of data saturation, which occurs when no new themes, perspectives, or insights emerge from additional data collection, indicating further interviews would likely yield redundant information (Fusch & Ness, 2015). Saturation is widely recognized as a key criterion in qualitative research to determine adequate sample size and ensure comprehensive data analysis.

The relative size of each generational cohort impacts their societal and workplace influence, making their representation in this study essential for capturing a diverse range of experiences. Baby boomers are the largest cohort, followed by millennials, generation X, and Gen Z, which is the smallest. This distribution affects the labor force, with baby boomers constituting a significant portion of the workforce, millennials and generation X forming the core labor pool, and Gen Z beginning to enter the workforce, impacting labor supply dynamics and economic trends (Page et al., 2024).

By ensuring representation from all generational cohorts in this study, we can better understand how different age groups experience and contribute to workplace culture, leadership structures, and industry changes. A diverse generational sample allows for a more comprehensive analysis of intergenerational collaboration, potential conflicts, and the evolving expectations that shape professional environments.

### Procedures

After receiving HSIRB approval, participants were invited to take part in a virtual interview. The interview guide sought to understand participants' experiences in the workplace with individuals from different generations as well as interactions with people from their same generation. A wide range of topics were discussed to better understand the stereotypes individuals have of other generations, the meta stereotypes they have of their generation, the benefits of working with other people from different generations, and their perception of how they operate in the workplace based on stigmas. More specifically, the semi-structured interview guide consisted of 30 questions which were broken down into three segments: perception of their generation, perception of other generations, and management support. Sample interview questions include: "What key words come to mind when you think of your generation?," "Can you think of some challenges or negative experiences you have encountered when working with people from different generations?" and "How do you think organizations combat stereotypes and promote inclusivity across generations in the workplace?"

### Data Analysis

A qualitative approach was employed to analyze the transcribed interviews. Following the interview, the researchers organized and reviewed the transcripts a minimum of three times each to identify major themes/codes. Major codes were identified and to visually showcase these themes within the transcripts, the researcher used a coding technique where each code was highlighted in different colors (Tracy, 2024). In addition, secondary codes were sought out in the transcripts, and are identifiable by how they are formatted (i.e. italicized). During the initial round of coding, several codes were explored such as workplace experience gaps, where different generations found themselves at varying levels of expertise and tenure, leading to disparities in knowledge, technological adaptability, and communication styles. Similarly, several secondary codes were identified, including career progression and development which highlighted generational differences in expectations around promotions, skill-building opportunities, and the desire for mentorship or leadership roles within the workplace. As the coding process progressed, the codes evolved based on further analysis and refinement of the transcripts. All main and secondary codes were documented in a comprehensive codebook. The codebook also contained definitions for each code, how to identify these themes in the transcriptions, and examples of each. These codes helped in evaluating the three research questions posed regarding this study. The process of identifying and refining these codes was key to developing broader themes and secondary themes. By grouping related codes together and analyzing patterns, the researcher was able to distill the complex data into meaningful themes that captured underlying trends in the participants' experiences. The final themes, three primary and three secondary, represent the culmination of this iterative coding process, with changes made to better capture the complexities identified in the data.

## Findings

The following section examines the feedback and perceptions of the four primary generations in the workforce regarding their own generation and others. Three major themes emerged from the research interviews: (a) generational differences in workplace values, (b) benefits of cross-generational collaboration in the workplace, and (c) accommodating intergenerational communication and collaboration in the workplace. Additionally, two secondary themes were identified, each related to a specific major theme: (a) frustration with laziness, which is associated with generational differences in workplace values, as it highlights the varying attitudes toward work ethic across generations and (b) cross-generational knowledge exchange, connected to benefits of cross-generational collaboration, reflecting how different generations can share expertise to enhance productivity and innovation. These themes provide an overview of the complex dynamics at play in a multigenerational workforce, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities that arise from diverse perspectives and experiences. For a visual representation of how these findings align with the research questions.

### Generational Differences in Workplace Values

One of the major themes identified and discussed across all four of the generations interviewed was generational differences in workplace values. This theme encompasses the distinct set of beliefs, morals, work ethics, and priorities each generation holds, as participants expressed how their own generation's values differ from those of others, shaping their perspectives and behaviors in professional settings. This theme is found in questions which asked about coworkers' perceptions of their own generation and questions which asked participants about their perceptions and work experiences with different generations.

**Baby Boomers.** Interviewees from the baby boomer cohort expressed how they hold more traditional values and believe they maintain their values more strongly than younger generations, emphasizing a sense of steadfastness in their beliefs and work ethic. For example, an interview with Adeline, a baby boomer who currently works in an elementary school, stated they have a "different work ethic" compared to younger generations and how they are not afraid to voice their concerns at work by stating "I voice my opinion. If someone says something, I have no problem telling them what I think about that because I lived it. I know it and I just tell them my point of view and they (younger generations) can take it or leave it. I definitely have a different mindset." Similar to Adeline, Melinda, an employee in the healthcare field, stated they "were instilled with a very modest way of living" and they "hold old fashion values" in the workplace. Melinda discussed how they have often judged younger generations for coming to work with their hair wet, which is something they were taught to never do in the workplace.

When asked in what ways they identify with being a baby boomer, Derek, a grocery store employee stated “I think a good part of it is due to the fact that when I was growing up, the mentality level was that you worked hard, you did your job and you collected your paycheck,” and “I was raised that you earned what you work for, what you earn, and you work hard at it. That is my feeling as far as my generation.” Derek also elaborated on how he does not perceive younger generations holding onto this same work ethic by commenting “I really don’t understand the concept younger generations have of ‘well, I don’t have to do this. I’ll just collect an unemployment check or welfare check or whatever’. I wasn’t raised that way.” These comments draw a connection between baby boomers believing they have different generational workplace values which younger generations do not live by.

**Generation X.** Interviewees from the generation X group expressed how their way of being raised provided them with unique standards to live by in the workplace. For example, Lucy, an employee working in the non-profit sector, remarked on how they were taught you were not to go home until your work was completed. “You know, here I am, probably one of maybe two people left on a Friday afternoon at 4:00 o’clock in the office. It’s partly because I’m thorough and also trying to get a project done.” Similar to Lucy, Jeffrey, also an employee working for a non-profit organization, expressed how younger generations rely heavily on technology and how his generation grew up without it. “(Millennials) seem a little more whiny, a little more entitled, a little more spoiled, and a little too reliant on technology” and “my generation was taught to be more independent, be less dependent on technology. I think it made us more critical thinkers compared to some younger generational folk.”

Maxine, another non-profit employee, also remarked on generation X’s ability to adapt since they grew up not having technology easily accessible. “... we are also adaptable because like you know, we started out in a generation of papers and pencils and drifted into computers and so we had to adapt.” Maxine went on to explain how other generations, particularly younger ones, do not carry the adaptability trait since they (younger generations) had technology readily available: “It may be stereotyping, but my generation got a really good handle on how to entertain ourselves without technology.” Rayleigh, a generation X government employee, also expressed how they have a unique benefit to their work values since they grew up without having technology. “Honestly, I grew up before the electronic age and I think that is a positive. I mean, I look at kids nowadays who have severe issues. They can’t put them (technological devices) down and it just drives me crazy. It’s like, will you please just learn how to do something the old-fashioned way or tune out from the electronics and do something, you know, like talk to people.” These comments and more made by generation X interviewees zoomed in on their generation being more adaptable, critical thinkers, and less reliant on technology which are all traits they believe to set them apart from other generations.

**Millennials.** Interviewees from the Millennial generation emphasized how their commitment to advocacy and driving change in systems established by previous

generations is a core value they believe sets their generation apart. For example, Jack, an employee who works with migrant families, stated “I think it’s because we have learned so much from our previous generations and their mistakes. . .” when asked why they like being a millennial. “I think we’re more aware of what’s happening in the world and in our jobs that we’re not willing to just settle and work a job for 30 years and then retire in the same position or the same company.”

“We are the generation of breaking generational curses” remarked Lilly, an employee in the grant making field. “As millennials, I think we’ve embraced this power that we have internally to create our own destiny, as cheesy as that sounds, but it’s what I believe in.” Lilly elaborated on how millennials embrace the will to make changes not only in their workplace but also for themselves on a micro level, which they believe other generations do not understand how to do or consider a workplace value.

When asked about key thoughts of their generation, Lylah, an employee for the State of Michigan in Child Welfare, stated “we want to make a difference and change the world and not let things continue to happen that shouldn’t.” Similar to Lylah, Tracy, an employee in higher education, remarked on how millennials are pushing to make changes in the workplace by stating “I think millennials are breaking some toxic workplace cultures and histories that have existed for a long time. . .” and “I feel like millennials are pushing back on a lot of things, like wanting the flexibility to work from home, valuing benefits, and work life balance over monetary compensation.” Throughout the millennial interviews, participants consistently expressed a desire to drive change and dismantle workplace systems that they believe are outdated or inequitable for themselves and others.

**Gen Z.** Gen Z interviewees noted differences between their generation and older ones related to their workplace values, particularly with their need to prove themselves and how they are not worried about trying new things in the workplace. Charlie, a Gen Z employee in a higher education stated, “I think we have a bad reputation for having ‘laziness’. But I think it’s more of us being more efficient rather than lazy because we’re getting our stuff done quicker.” Mark, a student employee in higher education, echoed this sentiment, explaining, “always hearing things like ‘your generation isn’t hard working’ makes me feel not good enough and that makes me push myself harder.” Mark referenced their job in fast food and their older generation boss often in their interview and made statements about how they feel judged by their supervisor solely because they are Gen Z. In order to overcome this, Mark stated they are continuously trying to find ways to show how hard of a worker they are. Many other Gen Z interviewees stated they had to go above and beyond to challenge misconceptions, as Karson, an employee at a marijuana dispensary stated, “sometimes, you have to go the extra mile just so people take you seriously.”

The next section will focus on the secondary theme of frustration with the laziness stereotype. Many Gen Z interviewees grapple with the notion they are inherently lazy, a characterization they find both misleading and frustrating. This secondary theme will explore not only the emotions surrounding this stereotype, but also how it manifests in their attitudes and body language.

*Frustration with Laziness.* When discussing stereotypes and meta-stereotypes, frustration has a notable pattern expressed through Gen Z participants' body language. Mark vividly displayed this frustration by sighing and huffing when talking about the perception of his generation as lazy. Mark's body language suggested offense and exasperation, as he elaborated on the need to constantly justify his work ethic to older generations. He shared personal anecdotes, including observing his mother's hard-working nature and adopting this trait himself at a very young age, to counter the lazy stereotype. Phoebe, an employee who works with migrant families, exhibited similar frustration through her scrunched eyebrows and the extra time she needed to respond to questions about her generation's stereotypes. Phoebe's reaction also indicated deep offense, and she voiced her concern about being unfairly categorized as lazy due to her age, expressing that such stereotypes hindered other generations from taking Gen Z individuals seriously. Charlie expressed irritation when discussing the stereotype of laziness. He felt compelled to justify that Gen Z tends to complete work quickly and efficiently, which can be misconstrued as laziness with the free time that follows.

This defense illustrated an emotional burden carried by Gen Z individuals. Their body language, ranging from confused or angry facial expressions to defensive postures with crossed arms, highlighted the impact of these stereotypes. This pervasive sense of frustration revealed how deeply these stereotypes affected their professional identity and interactions, compelling them to feel as though they had to constantly prove their worth and combat negative assumptions imposed by older generations.

While younger generations expressed frustration at being labeled as lazy by older generations, they also recognize the value of collaboration across age groups in the workplace. This acknowledgment highlights a nuanced understanding of the dynamics between generations, where frustrations can coexist with appreciation for diverse perspectives and skills. The next section explores the primary theme of the benefits of cross-generational collaboration, emphasizing how the blending of experiences and ideas can lead to innovative solutions.

### *Benefits of Cross-Generational Knowledge Collaboration in the Workplace*

Despite negative stereotypes, especially of Gen Z, all participants emphasized the benefits and significance of collaborating with colleagues from different generations in the workplace. Overwhelmingly, participants either made a comment which related to how they felt it was necessary to work with other people from different generations or they provided examples of the benefits they have received. This theme is found in questions which asked participants if they find working with people from different generations helpful and if so, how and if they have ever received mentorship or advice from someone from a different generation and in questions which asked them to discuss each generation they have worked with and if there were any particular experiences which came to mind when discussing them.

An example of the participants expressing the vitality of working with different generations can be seen in Karson's, a Gen Z participant, interview. Karson stated

"Yes, I have found it helpful working with other generations and just to tie it back to the knowledge and experience part. . . they just act as guides through the workplace. . ." Karson's perspective challenges common assumptions that Gen Z prefers to work independently or struggles with workplace collaboration. Instead, his statement highlights Gen Z's appreciation for mentorship and guidance from older colleagues, recognizing their experience as an asset rather than a barrier. Derek, a baby boomer, stated " . . . you can see more possibilities than if you just have one generation working on an issue because their mindset is only for their generations mindset. . . I've had a good response with all generations when we have done group meetings to figure out things." The insights from both Karson and Derek emphasize how valuable intergenerational collaboration can be in the workplace with Gen Z actively engaging in and benefiting from these interactions.

Virtually all participants reported experiencing a mentorship of some type with a coworker from another generation. More specifically, 27 out of the 30 participants reported they received mentorship from someone from a different generation in their workplace and that it was beneficial. For example, Jack, a millennial participant, stated "I have (received mentorship) from generation X and (baby) boomers, they have a lot of institutional knowledge that is helpful for me in my position." Lucy, a generation X individual, also commented on the institutional knowledge their mentor had of their workplace and how this was helpful for them. Lucy stated " . . . their advice to me was that even though I feel they have more knowledge than me, being creative is what will help make me feel competent in my role. I just moved into my position and this advice helped me a ton. . ." Gen Z participants, like Karson, who readily acknowledged the benefits of mentorship contradicts the notion that they are resistant to traditional workplace structures and instead shows their adaptability and openness to learning. This emphasis on mentorship highlights the vital role of cross-generational knowledge exchange in fostering professional growth which leads us to explore this secondary theme in greater detail.

**Cross-Generational Knowledge Exchange.** Participants emphasized being in an intergenerational workplace afforded them opportunities to learn skills from other generations which they believed they would not be able to acquire in a workplace that only employed individuals from their same generation. This was particularly true for Gen Z, who were identified as both learners and educators. For example, Rayleigh, a generation X participant, highlighted the importance of learning how technology can enhance their job through collaboration with a Gen Z colleague. Rayleigh works closely with juveniles in the court system and part of their job responsibilities is to monitor their assigned youth's online usage. When asked if they have found it helpful to work with individuals from different generations, Rayleigh stated "It is helpful. I learn from them, especially with electronics, like the example I gave with Snapchat. I had no idea I could track some of their (juveniles) old posts and that kind of stuff. Working with Gen Z, I was able to learn that." This example demonstrates how Gen Z is not just receiving knowledge but actively contributing to workplace efficiency and innovation by sharing their technological expertise.

Ashley, a millennial who works with clients spanning various age groups, highlighted the importance of learning and understanding diverse communication styles across different ages and ethnicities, noting its significant impact on her job. Ashley commented on how collaborating and knowledge sharing with colleagues from not only Gen Z, but also older generations, has granted them the ability to perform better in their work with clients. Ashley stated "... especially with my job. I work with people of all ages and ethnicities and so I think it helps when we have interactions with people from different generations. It can kind of give us knowledge on how to work with specific clients. ... it definitely helps us or helps me think of different ways on how I can speak to an individual and kind of understand them in a better way."

Participants shared examples or experiences demonstrating how collaborating with a colleague from a different generation enhanced their job performance. Their exposure to diverse technical skills and various viewpoints contributed to the participants' professional growth and adaptation in the workplace, while also enabling them to teach their colleagues about their own lived experiences and skills. Tracy, a millennial participant who supervises a group of Gen Z student workers at a university, sees themselves as a peer to these individuals and enjoys teaching them something new in their role. Tracy also derives satisfaction from witnessing their success. Tracy stated, "... [the] positive experiences I have had with my role is I really enjoy going through the learning process with them when they finally kind of nail something and feel excited about it. They really know what they're doing and I feel really excited and proud with them and for them." Being in a work atmosphere where multiple generations co-exist allows for cross collaboration so these participants can not only learn from others, but also teach others.

This dynamic of collaboration reveals the importance of cross-generational knowledge exchange while also highlighting the necessity for accommodating intergenerational communication. As participants noted, being mindful of these differences is essential for effectively navigating the workplace and accomplishing tasks, ensuring that each generation can contribute their unique strengths to the team. The next section focuses on how participants expressed their different ways of accommodating communication styles to enhance collaboration and productivity in a multigenerational workplace.

### *Accommodating Intergenerational Communication and Collaboration in the Workplace*

The majority of participants, 26 out of 30 interviews, highlighted their proactive adaptation and accommodation of colleagues from different generations in terms of communication and collaboration. These participants recognized the importance of understanding and respecting generational differences in communication styles by actively seeking out how their colleagues preferred to communicate. Communication methods discussed ranged from email, phone calls, face to face interaction, and text messaging. Participants' adaptive approach not only fostered smoother interpersonal interactions, but also enhanced teamwork and productivity. Participants shared examples of how they would adapt their communication style based on their colleagues' preferences, even if it differed from their own preferred methods.

For example, Angela, a millennial employee who works in Child Welfare, discussed how they already have a plan in place when it comes to communicating with the different generations in her workplace. Angela stated “I approach generation X or baby boomers a lot differently than the way I would be approached. . . I’m going to walk over and, you know, kind of have that conversation face to face.” And “Whereas Gen Z, we would communicate mostly through email or through text or you know, just more of that technology related stuff. So I would say that’s kind of how I shift my approach with people. . . I kind of adjust based on what the interests of people are.”

Barry, a Gen Z participant, stressed how they try to accommodate those who are not as equipped or as comfortable with using technology to communicate by meeting with them face to face. Barry stated “If somebody’s not as connected, it’s always just easier for them that way. There’s no misinterpretation or anything like that, so there is accommodation for somebody else who might not see the online resources as appealing.” Successfully collaborating with colleagues from different generations depended on the participant’s ability to identify and use different ways of communicating, whether this meant stepping away from their default communication comfort zone.

Participants also emphasized the importance of ensuring their colleagues from different generations than theirs were in a stage of comfort when communicating with them. For example, Michael, a Gen Z participant, discussed how they appreciate when other colleagues listen to them and their communication preferences and how they want others to feel this way, too. Michael stated “I always appreciate it when someone acknowledges I prefer phone calls and then they call me. So I try to return that feeling when I can.” Another participant, Charlie, a Gen Z participant, expressed how they adapt with their communication methods, in hopes of making their coworkers feel comfortable. Charlie stated “I usually just try to adapt to their preference of style. The greatest example might be email responses or formalities over technology communications. . . I just try to adapt to make it easier for them since that’s what they’re used to.”

Creating a comfortable way of communicating allowed for reduced misunderstandings and promoted inclusivity among colleagues. Karson, a Gen Z participant, stated “I feel like once you’re open to how everyone else, such as people from different generations, how they like things and how they work best, you get a better understanding of what everybody needs. Then things can be run smoothly and there can be some compromise in the workplace, which can make things work better.” Every participant highlighted how listening, having an open-mind or using a different approach when communicating with different generations provided a space where colleagues felt recognized and content in their collaborations.

Taken together, the findings illustrate an understanding of how stereotypes and meta-stereotypes about Gen Z individuals impact their workplace dynamics and how generational differences are perceived as beneficial. The theme of perceptions of Gen Z colleagues revealed that while they are often praised for their technological adeptness and eagerness to take on new tasks, they also face criticism for perceived laziness and potential overuse of mental health breaks. These mixed perceptions shape how Gen Z collaborates with peers and superiors, highlighting the importance of breaking down negative stereotypes to foster better teamwork. The benefits of cross-generational collaboration emerged strongly, with participants from all generations recognizing the

value of diverse perspectives and skills, particularly through mentorship and knowledge exchange. This collaboration not only enhances job performance but also promotes a culture of mutual learning and respect. Lastly, accommodating intergenerational communication styles was crucial in creating a harmonious work environment. Participants adapted their communication methods to suit colleagues' preferences, ensuring smoother interactions and more effective teamwork. These findings collectively address the research questions by illustrating how positive stereotypes about Gen Z's tech skills and eagerness can enhance their collaboration with peers, and how recognizing and adapting to generational differences can lead to a more inclusive and productive workplace.

## Discussion

While much discussion and speculation exist regarding the integration of Gen Z into the workforce, empirical research remains limited (Mann, 2022). This study contributes meaningfully to the scholarly conversation in several ways. First, by examining both stereotypes and meta-stereotypes across four generations, this research sheds light on generational perceptions and workplace dynamics. Notably, these differences were largely perceived as strengths rather than barriers. In many cases, participants described how generational stereotypes shaped their initial expectations of colleagues and also how those expectations evolved through direct interaction. These initial expectations often stemmed from observable behaviors, such as differing communication styles, preferred technologies, or attitudes toward work-life balance. Employees reported recognizing generational differences through day-to-day interactions, informal conversations, and distinct preferences in task execution or collaboration methods. An overarching sense of optimism emerged, with participants across generations expressing enthusiasm for learning from and collaborating with colleagues of different age groups. Many respondents also indicated a willingness to adjust their communication styles to better align with those of colleagues from other generations—an act often motivated by a desire to counter negative stereotypes or avoid generational misunderstandings (Urick et al., 2017). Finally, this study underscores the necessity of clear and ongoing communication from both organizations and managers to mitigate potential misunderstandings and address concerns related to working with Gen Z employees. These findings, along with practical recommendations, are explored in greater detail below.

### Theoretical Implications

**Accommodation and Relationship Building.** Optimism was prevalent across all generations, as most participants identified clear benefits in collaborating with colleagues from different age cohorts. This enthusiasm aligns with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which emphasizes the role of observational learning in behavior development (Bandura, 1986). Employees frequently learn from one another by observing diverse approaches to work. For instance, younger employees often adopt best practices from

their more experienced colleagues, while senior employees gain fresh insights and technological proficiency from younger generations. A prime example was a generation X participant who described learning how to use Snapchat more effectively from a younger colleague. Beyond the technical skills acquired, this exchange fostered deeper professional connections and mutual understanding.

Participants also highlighted their efforts to accommodate different communication styles when working with colleagues from other generations. Many adjusted their communication to bridge potential gaps. In some cases, employees identified generational differences by noticing preferences for tools (e.g., email vs. instant messaging), response times, or even the level of formality in greetings and meeting etiquette. These cues helped them decide how to best tailor their communication to suit generational norms. For example, shifting from formal to more casual language with younger employees or adopting more structured communication when engaging with older colleagues. This adaptability facilitated smoother interactions and fostered mutual respect, ultimately strengthening collaboration. These findings suggest that generational communication stereotypes may, in some cases, prompt individuals to proactively adjust their approach, helping to bridge perceived differences.

The ability to adjust communication styles underscores the importance of flexibility and empathy in bridging generational gaps in the workplace. These moments of flexibility often stem not only from a desire to build stronger relationships, but also from an awareness of prevailing generational stereotypes, such as the belief that older generations resist change or that younger ones lack professionalism. By consciously adapting their behavior, participants challenged these assumptions in real time, modeling how cross-generational collaboration can actively disrupt stereotype-driven expectations. Yet, even when we try to accommodate the communication preferences of others, misunderstandings can still occur.

**Self-Regulation is Critical for Growth.** SCT explains how employees engage in self-regulation and modify their behavior in response to generational stereotypes and metastereotypes. While some participants embraced positive traits associated with their generation, others rejected these labels, feeling they did not match their personal experiences. This highlights the self-regulation process, where individuals adjust their behavior based on internal reflections and feedback from others (Bandura, 1991).

For instance, a Gen Z participant noted they had to modify their communication style when working with older colleagues, choosing a more formal tone to align with their expectations. This adjustment reflects self-regulation, as the individual adapted to generational preferences to maintain effective communication and reduce misunderstandings.

To identify generational expectations, employees often relied on patterns in feedback from supervisors or peers. For instance, repeated comments about communication tone, pace, or professionalism often signaled misalignments tied to generational norms. Employees also engage in observational learning, observing peers and leaders who navigate generational stereotypes effectively. By witnessing others successfully challenge these stereotypes, employees are influenced to adjust their behaviors accordingly (Olson et al., 2009). This is further supported by role modeling, as individuals

see how others overcome generational assumptions and achieve success. These observations help enhance self-efficacy, as employees feel empowered to change their communication and work styles to better align with the workplace's needs. This process often involves navigating not only externally imposed stereotypes but also internalized meta-stereotypes. These perceptions can significantly influence how individuals regulate their behavior, particularly when they seek to disconfirm negative expectations or reinforce positive ones.

By understanding and responding to both stereotypes and meta-stereotypes, employees demonstrate agency in shaping more equitable generational dynamics at work. Ultimately, this self-regulation, guided by observational learning and role modeling, allows employees to modify their behaviors, creating more inclusive and productive intergenerational interactions.

*Communication is Essential.* Stereotypes about generational work attitudes and boundaries emerged as a point of tension in participants' descriptions of workplace dynamics, particularly regarding mental health leave. Non-Gen Z participants expressed fear that members of the newest generation in the workforce may abuse mental health leave or cross other interpersonal boundaries, a concern that aligns with broader stereotypes depicting Gen Z as prioritizing personal well-being over professional responsibilities. This continued concern reiterates the need for frequent and clear communication at all levels of the organization to mitigate these perceptions and build trust. For example, a participant in a titled leadership position indicated fear that Gen Z employees were taking advantage of mental health leave. This concern can quickly be resolved through thoughtful onboarding processes, transparent policies, and ongoing dialogue.

Proactive communication not only helps clarify organizational norms but also serves as a strategy to counteract meta-stereotypes. Reciprocal determinism (Schiavo et al., 2019), another element of SCT, underscores how open communication shapes a collaborative and effective workplace environment. When leaders and employees engage in transparent dialogue, they not only set clear expectations but also create a feedback loop where behaviors are continuously adjusted based on mutual understanding and reinforcement. For instance, by discussing and addressing concerns about mental health leave, organizations can model appropriate behaviors and set realistic boundaries, while employees learn to navigate these norms effectively. Participants noted that age-based assumptions often surfaced during moments of policy interpretation or use, such as the perceived overuse of mental health leave, making these moments key indicators of generational differences. These interpretations were shaped not only by direct behavior, but also by anecdotal experiences shared among team members. Participants' willingness to adjust their communication style suggests that meta-stereotypes may drive individuals to adopt more accommodating behaviors. This reciprocal influence enhances self-efficacy among employees, particularly those from Gen Z, as they receive clear guidance and support, which in turn creates a more harmonious and productive workplace culture.

Furthermore, participants highlighted several instances where misunderstandings and concerns were effectively addressed through proactive measures. One millennial

participant described how receiving valuable institutional knowledge from generation X and baby boomer mentors helped alleviate concerns about generational inefficiencies. Similarly, a generation X participant learned to use new technology more effectively through collaboration with Gen Z colleagues, resolving issues related to technological gaps and improving overall workplace productivity. These examples illustrate how intentional relationship-building strategies, such as mentorship and knowledge sharing, help to mitigate stereotypes and strengthen workplace dynamics.

### Pragmatic Implications

*Using Reverse Mentoring to Enhance Intergenerational Collaboration.* Incorporating reverse mentoring into the workplace is a promising way to create stronger relationships and improve team dynamics across generational divides. Reverse mentoring, where younger employees mentor their older counterparts, offers a unique opportunity for both generations to learn from one another and challenge preconceived stereotypes (Marcinkus Murphy, 2012). For example, younger employees often have more familiarity with emerging technologies and trends, making them ideal mentors for older employees seeking to improve their tech skills. In turn, older employees bring valuable experience and knowledge, especially regarding organizational culture, industry-specific insights, and problem-solving strategies. This reciprocal exchange not only enhances the skills of both generations but also fosters an environment of mutual respect and understanding.

Research has shown the more individuals from different generations interact with one another, the more likely they are to develop positive attitudes and form strong interpersonal bonds (Leedahl et al., 2020). Reverse mentoring can be instrumental in creating such interactions, especially when implemented within team settings. As employees collaborate in a reverse mentoring relationship, they become more familiar with each other's perspectives and strengths, which naturally leads to greater empathy and collaboration. This mutual engagement breaks down stereotypes by highlighting the value of each generation's contributions, making it easier for employees to see beyond generational labels and recognize the unique skills of their colleagues. Furthermore, reverse mentoring helps alleviate the negative stereotypes that often arise about younger employees, such as the perception that Gen Z lacks work ethic or is overly reliant on technology. As younger employees take on mentoring roles, they have the opportunity to dispel these misconceptions by demonstrating their competence and leadership.

In addition to improving interpersonal relationships, reverse mentoring can also have a significant impact on workplace communication. By engaging in regular reverse mentoring sessions, both generations can practice adapting their communication styles to suit each other's preferences. Younger employees might learn to communicate more effectively in formal settings, while older employees can gain proficiency in the informal, technology-driven communication methods favored by younger generations. This enhanced communication creates a more cohesive team environment where members are comfortable sharing ideas and offering constructive feedback. Moreover, reverse mentoring can be an antidote to meta-stereotypes, as it

challenges the perceptions that each generation has about the other. When older employees see younger colleagues in leadership roles and vice versa, it helps to break down internalized assumptions and allows for a more fluid understanding of generational strengths and weaknesses.

Reverse mentoring stands as a valuable tool for addressing generational gaps, improving communication, and enhancing overall team cohesion. By creating a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, reverse mentoring not only supports individual development but also strengthens organizational dynamics as a whole.

**Hosting Group Meetings and Lunch and Learns.** Allowing age-diverse workgroups to regularly share and report out on their individual projects can significantly highlight each team member's expertise and create cross-generational learning (George et al., 2024). When employees from different generations present their work, it not only showcases their unique skills and approaches but also encourages the entire team to appreciate different problem-solving techniques and knowledge bases. This practice illuminates the value of each individual's contributions, creating opportunities for team members to learn from one another. It also facilitates a deeper understanding of how different generations approach tasks, which can inspire innovative solutions and enhance collaborative efforts.

Similarly, integrating quarterly lunch and learn sessions where employees take turns sharing their skills, techniques, or approaches can be a powerful tool for collective learning and recognition. These sessions provide a platform for employees to demonstrate their expertise and teach their colleagues, creating an environment of continuous learning and mutual respect (Brassey et al., 2019). By highlighting a specific employee each session, the organization not only acknowledges individual contributions, but also promotes knowledge sharing across the team. This collaborative learning environment helps break down generational barriers, encourages cross-generational mentorship, and builds a more cohesive and informed workforce.

**Encouraging Flexible Communication Styles.** Another pragmatic implication of this research is the importance of encouraging flexible communication styles across generational lines. The study found that employees are willing to adapt their communication approaches to accommodate colleagues from different generations, which is crucial for improving team dynamics and reducing misunderstandings. Organizations should promote and normalize the idea that communication is not one-size-fits-all, and different age groups may have varying preferences or approaches.

To facilitate this, managers can implement training programs or workshops that focus on developing adaptable communication strategies. These could include providing guidance on how to effectively interact with colleagues who have different communication styles, such as using more formal language for older generations or embracing more direct and digital communication with younger employees. Additionally, encouraging team members to observe and learn from one another's communication styles and offering constructive feedback in a supportive environment

can help bridge any gaps and improve team cohesion. This approach not only reduces the risk of miscommunication but also strengthens intergenerational collaboration and fosters a more inclusive workplace culture.

### *Limitations and Future Research*

While the research presents valuable insights into intergenerational dynamics, it also has shortcomings that should be addressed. Firstly, the reliance on interview data introduces a potential risk of social desirability bias, where participants may provide responses they believe are expected rather than those that reflect their true feelings or behaviors. Additionally, the study's cross-sectional design limits its ability to capture the evolution of generational attitudes and interactions over time. Longitudinal research would be more effective in tracking changes and understanding the long-term impact of interventions aimed at improving generational collaboration.

To build on these findings, future research should integrate more quantitative measures and/or pursue a mixed-methods design. Incorporating surveys and statistical analyses can help identify broader trends and patterns across generations, providing a more comprehensive view of intergenerational dynamics. By combining qualitative and quantitative data, future studies can enhance the reliability and generalizability of the results, offering a robust foundation for developing targeted interventions and policies that address generational differences in the workplace.

## **Conclusion**

The current research contributes to understanding the integration of Gen Z into the workforce, providing empirical data where it has been previously sparse. This study illuminates perceptions and dynamics across four generations, highlighting stereotypes and meta-stereotypes, which were largely seen as a strength, contrary to popular opinion. Optimism was evident, with all generations expressing hopefulness in learning from and working with one another, alongside a willingness to adapt communication styles to bridge generational gaps. The data emphasizes the necessity of clear, ongoing communication from both organizational leaders and managers to prevent misunderstandings and address concerns about working with not only Gen Z but all generations in the workplace.

The theoretical implications underscore the dynamic interplay between individual identity, self-regulation, and generational stereotypes, highlighting how employees actively navigate and challenge assumptions through observational learning, accommodation, and behavior modification. Pragmatically, the findings advocate for the implementation of structured communication strategies, such as reverse mentoring programs and flexible communication training. These recommendations offer actionable pathways to dismantle generational stereotypes, promote mutual learning, and create more inclusive workplaces. By embracing generational diversity through intentional relationship-building and adaptable

communication practices, organizations can cultivate stronger team cohesion and enhance overall workplace culture.
