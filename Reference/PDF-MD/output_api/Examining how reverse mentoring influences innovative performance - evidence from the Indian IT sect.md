## Abstract

**Purpose** – This study aims to examine the underlying psychological mechanisms and boundary conditions in explaining the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance. Using the job demands and resources theory, this study argues that reverse mentoring acts as a job resource in fostering employees' personal resources (i.e. resilience and agility), consequently enhancing innovative performance. Moreover, it examines the moderating role of organizational structure in the above-mentioned association.

**Design/methodology/approach** – Data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic from a sample of 382 employees working in the Indian information technology (IT) sector were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling to test the proposed hypotheses.

**Findings** – Results reveal that agility partially mediated the association of reverse mentoring with innovative performance. Organizational structure (formalization and centralization) significantly negatively moderated the positive influence of reverse mentoring on innovative performance.

**Practical implications** – To enhance innovative performance at work, organizations should focus on building resilience and agile capabilities of employees through bottom-up knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring. To facilitate the effectiveness of such a contemporary approach to knowledge sharing in enhancing employees' innovative performance, managers should align the organizational structure to be less formal and decentralize decision-making.

**Originality/value** – This study innovates by examining the unexplored role of reverse mentoring on resilience, agility and innovative performance in the underexplored domain of the Indian IT context. Moreover, it advances the literature on conditions under which bottom-up knowledge-sharing practices will flourish.

## 1. Introduction

Research suggests that tacit knowledge-sharing drives innovative performance, which is key to achieving sustainable competitive advantage in knowledge-intensive firms such as the information technology (IT) sector (Cao *et al.*, 2022; Dzenopoljac *et al.*, 2024; Le and Ha, 2024; Malik, 2022). As it operates in a dynamic environment characterized by rapid technological advancements, young employees well-versed with contemporary technologies and digital tools serve as invaluable assets in the IT industry (Marcinkus Murphy, 2012; Zaman and Ansari, 2023). Yet firms today find it challenging to engage the new generation at work and instigate

them to be innovative. On the other hand, the younger generation strives for flexibility, higher involvement in knowledge sharing and meaningful connections at work. The changing expectations of employees and the need for employers to have higher innovative performance can be achieved with practices such as reverse mentoring. Reverse mentoring is a bottom-up approach to knowledge sharing wherein junior employees serve as mentors to more experienced senior employees as mentees to facilitate cross-generational learning (Marcinkus Murphy, 2012). The existing studies on reverse mentoring suggest that it is an informal, bottom-up approach to knowledge sharing that is deemed crucial in the knowledge-intensive information technology industry (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Garg et al., 2022).

While the primary objective of reverse mentoring is to share knowledge and bridge the technological divide between intergenerational groups, over time, it has emerged as an innovative method to develop talent and leadership competencies and enhance employee engagement, learning and performance (Chaudhuri et al., 2021). Reverse mentoring was institutionalized by Jack Welch over two decades ago and has been adopted by several organizations, such as General Motors, Procter and Gamble and Unilever (Garg et al., 2022). However, the academic research is limited by the conceptual nature of the papers, as empirical evidence remained scant (Kaše, Saksida, and Mihelič, 2018). Empirical work on reverse mentoring has gained traction in the recent past following the scale development by Garg et al. (2021). Subsequently, research has examined the role of reverse mentoring as a job resource in enhancing employees' work engagement, performance and health and reducing withdrawal behavior and turnover intentions (Garg et al., 2022). More recently, it has been underscored as a valuable method for employee development and retention in the post-COVID workplace (Jayathilake et al., 2021; Upadhyay and Singh, 2023). Yet the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance remains scarcely tested. Moreover, the motivational process explaining the influence of reverse mentoring on work outcomes and factors influencing the strength of this association remains lesser explored (Kaše et al., 2018; Upadhyay and Singh, 2023). In this study, we aim to address these gaps in the literature by exploring the underlying mechanism and boundary condition that explains the positive influence of reverse mentoring on a mentor's innovative performance.

Kaše et al. (2018) note that by participating in reverse mentoring, mentors experience positive emotions that broaden their thought-action repertoires and motivate them to explore and gain new knowledge and experience that builds their personal resources. Reverse mentoring offers young mentors access to new information and knowledge to be proactive and social support that aids their ability to bounce back (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012). It also offers young mentors a learning-oriented climate, social support, autonomy and training, all of which are resources to foster employee resilience and agility (Bardoel et al., 2014; Caniels and Baaten, 2018; Salmen and Festing, 2021). In sum, we argue that employees' participation in reverse mentoring can aid their resilience and agility.

Employee resilience and agility as personal resources help employees exert control over their work environment (Hobfoll et al., 2003). Moreover, resilient and agile employees are more likely to participate in innovative work behaviors, as evidence suggests that organizational resilience and agility drive firm innovativeness (Abukhait et al., 2020; Bimrose and Hearne, 2012; Ilmudeen, 2022). Therefore, the study argues that resilience and agility will act as mediators in the positive association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance. Despite industry reports suggesting that resilience and agility are the key capabilities behind the survival and success of the IT industry in today's work environment (Mishra, 2023; Reisch, 2021), research has not been given due focus to examine the role of reverse mentoring to foster resilience and agility for enhancing innovative performance.

Furthermore, bottom-up knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring might not reap positive work outcomes in an organization with rigid structures. Tremblay (2019) notes that the contingency approach argues that human resource practices are more efficient when they are aligned with the organizational structure. As an alternative to traditional mentoring, reverse mentoring will thrive in a flat organizational structure (Chen, 2013). On the other hand, as formal organizational structure influences an individual's knowledge-sharing propensity through informal methods (Caimo and Lomi, 2015), it can hinder the positive impact of reverse mentoring. Moreover, research suggests that high centralization in organizational structure negatively moderates knowledge management capabilities and innovation (Shafique et al., 2022). Therefore, we posit that the positive influence of reverse mentoring on innovative performance will be influenced by high centralization and formalization, such that high formalization and centralization will diminish the beneficial influence of reverse mentoring on innovative performance. In summary, we aim to address the gap in the literature by examining a moderated mediation model explaining the underlying mechanism and boundary conditions of the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance.

The study aims to contribute in several ways. First, it contributes to the notable gap in the literature on reverse mentoring and its association with innovative performance. Examining this association is important as survival in the IT industry requires employees to bounce back, be adaptive and perform innovatively. Therefore, the adoption of contemporary knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring can be a source of competitive advantage for IT firms as it enhances young mentors' resilience and agility and, consequently, innovative performance. Moreover, by examining the underlying psychological mechanism and the boundary conditions that influence the positive effect of reverse mentoring on innovative performance, the study underscores conditions under which informal knowledge-sharing methods will thrive. Existing studies have used a social exchange lens to explain the positive influence of reverse mentoring on work outcomes. However, this study suggests that participating in reverse mentoring acts as a job resource and positively influences employees' personal resources such as resilience and agility, consequently leading to enhanced innovative performance. As the positive influence of reverse mentoring on work outcomes (such as innovative performance) depends on the level of formalization and centralization of decision-making, the study examines the moderating role of organizational structure. Theoretically, it contributes to the growing body of literature on job demands and resources theory by underscoring the role of job resources (reverse mentoring) in fostering personal resources such as resilience and agility for enhancing innovative performance. The findings of this study hold practical implications for managers in IT firms to incorporate a bottom-up approach to knowledge sharing. Reverse mentoring not only contributes to the organization's competitiveness through innovative performance but also strengthens employees' personal resources through resilience and agility.

## 2. Theoretical framework

The research objective of this study builds on the tenets of the job demands-resources theory (JD-R) (Demerouti et al., 2001). The JD-R theory is a theoretical framework that predicts work outcomes based on the interaction between job resources and personal resources. Wherein job resources are “physical, psychological (i.e. cognitive and emotional), and social, or organizational aspects of the job that may do any of the following:

- be functional in achieving work goals;
- reduce job demands at the associated physiological and psychological costs; and
- stimulate personal growth and development” (Demerouti et al., 2001, p. 501).

Examining the motivational process, evidence suggests that reverse mentoring acts as a job resource in positively influencing employees' work engagement, health and performance (Garg *et al.*, 2021, 2022). JD-R theory was further extended to include personal resources (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). Personal resources refer to the individual's ability to have control over their environment (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017) such that it interacts with job resources to predict work outcomes (Demerouti *et al.*, 2001; Xanthopoulou *et al.*, 2007). Based on this theory, our study contends that job resources such as reverse mentoring positively influence personal resources such as resilience and agility, consequently enhancing their work outcome (i.e. innovative performance). Moreover, as aspects of organizational structure (i.e. formalization and centralization) can hinder goal attainment in the context of innovation, the study examines their moderating effect on the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance.

## 3. Literature review and hypotheses development

### 3.1 Reverse mentoring and employee resilience and agility

Reverse mentoring refers to an innovative practice of knowledge sharing wherein a younger junior employee mentors an older or hierarchically senior executive by sharing technological expertise, subject matter advances and/or providing a distinct perspective (Marcinkus Murphy, 2012). Such organizational support in the form of opportunities for professional growth and development may increase employees' personal resources at work by facilitating their learning and supporting goal achievement (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012). Reverse mentoring offers young mentors access to tacit organizational knowledge and social support, equipping them with the ability to bounce back and become more adaptive (Mafabi *et al.*, 2012; Niu, 2010). Building strong relationships and communication with senior members in the organization makes it easier to overcome challenges, thereby fostering resilience (Blaigue, Ismail, and Aldabbas, 2023; Jayathilake *et al.*, 2021). Moreover, it facilitates personal learning and the formation of social capital, which relates to employee resilience and agility (Salmen and Festing, 2021).

Resilience entails an employee's ability to adapt and overcome challenges at work by using organizational resources (Kuntz *et al.*, 2017). Agility is the ability of employees to quickly respond to change, exploit it and take opportunistic advantage of it (Breu *et al.*, 2002; Wei *et al.*, 2020). Researchers and practitioners note that personal resources such as resilience and agility are key to survival and sustenance in today's work environment (Forsdick, 2022; McCann, Selsky, and Lee, 2009). Moreover, while they have common characteristics, "a focus on agility without a focus on resilience could lead to a negative impact on employees with increased stress levels and, ultimately, less than optimal results" (Braun *et al.*, 2017, p. 716). Therefore, following the recommendation of Gölgeci *et al.* (2019), this study conceptualized resilience and agility together in the context of highly innovative industries such as IT.

Past studies also revealed a significant positive association between knowledge management and knowledge sharing, with organizational agility and resilience (Mafabi *et al.*, 2012; Rafi *et al.*, 2021), and most of these knowledge-sharing practices are top-down processes. As the current IT workforce is marked by a shift toward Millennials constituting the majority of the workforce, bottom-up practices are required to keep them engaged (Garg *et al.*, 2021). As tech-savvy employees within the Indian IT industry strive for early recognition, strong networking with superiors, and appropriate career support, it can be argued that reverse mentoring may act as a job resource in fostering their personal resources (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Garg *et al.*, 2021). Therefore, we contend that employees' participation in reverse mentoring can build their personal resources (resilience and agility).

However, empirical evidence regarding the role of reverse mentoring in fostering employee agility and resilience remains scant. Therefore, it is proposed that:

H1a. Reverse mentoring will be positively associated with employee resilience

H1b. Reverse mentoring will be positively associated with employee agility.

### 3.2 Employee resilience, agility and innovative performance

Innovative performance refers to the proficiency of employee behaviors designed for achieving innovative outcomes, consisting of the generation and execution of novel and beneficial ideas (Janssen, 2001). In an uncertain, turbulent and challenging IT environment, the importance of being ready to respond to changes and increase innovation is crucial (Franco and Landini, 2022). To be innovative, employees need to be engaged in their jobs and must have high personal resources to invest in their roles (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). Therefore, firms require flexible and adaptable talent, agile in their thoughts and approach, to quickly adapt to internal and external changes and perform innovatively (Gouda and Tiwari, 2021).

While some research suggests that agility mirrors a firm's readiness to respond to business changes rapidly and innovatively (Lu and Ramamurthy, 2011; Teece et al., 2016), others point to the fact that resilience and agility drive firm innovativeness (Abukhait et al., 2020; Bimrose and Hearne, 2012; Ilmudeen, 2022). Moreover, evidence also suggests that resilient individuals are more likely to pursue novel, creative and unscripted paths of thought and action and perform innovatively (Tugade and Fredrickson, 2004). Recent studies have also established that organizational resilience and trait resilience are key to innovation, yet their association with employee resilience remains lesser explored (Caniels et al., 2022; Garrido-Moreno et al., 2024). Moreover, agile employees are likely to demonstrate more innovative behavior (Ajgaonkar et al., 2022; Salmen and Festing, 2021). Therefore, it is proposed that:

H2a. Employee resilience will be positively related to innovative performance.

H2b. Employee agility will be positively related to innovative performance.

### 3.3 Employee resilience and agility as mediators

Knowledge management is crucial to innovative performance (Le and Ha, 2024; Le and Le, 2022; Than et al., 2023). As a relatively new area of research, reverse mentoring is considered to be one of the unique and sustainable methods to boost employee performance and innovation (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Garg et al., 2021). Theoretically, when employees participate in reverse mentoring and knowledge sharing, it enables them to be more resilient and agile and consequently demonstrate more innovative work behaviors (Ok and Lim, 2022). The mentor in the dyad has been found to benefit from heightened visibility and access to organizational knowledge as a result of working with senior colleagues, which develops their agility and instigates them to perform innovatively (Marcinkus Murphy, 2012; Salmen and Festing, 2021). Reverse mentoring is grounded in intergenerational knowledge transfer, which is a key factor for resilience in the face of uncertainty and adversity and relates to innovative behavior (Kuntz, 2021; Noopur and Dhar, 2020). The underlying mechanism is better explained by the JD-R theory, which suggests that job resources, such as reverse mentoring, foster personal resources (resilience and agility), which lead to innovative performance. Past studies have found substantial evidence for the role of personal resources in mediating the association between job resources (reverse mentoring) and work outcomes (Garg et al., 2021; Xanthopoulos et al., 2007). This study contends that by participating in

reverse mentoring relationships, employees are better equipped to be resilient and agile and, therefore, will perform more innovatively. Therefore, we propose that:

H3a. Employee resilience will mediate the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance.

H3b. Employee agility will mediate the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance.

### 3.4 Organizational structure as a moderator

So far, the study has argued that reverse mentoring (knowledge-sharing practice) enhances innovative performance by fostering employee resilience and agility. Existing literature suggests that the effectiveness of knowledge-sharing practices, such as reverse mentoring, in influencing work outcomes is contingent upon organizational structure (Shafique et al., 2022). Such that the positive effect of reverse mentoring on work outcomes is facilitated or constrained by the organizational structure. According to Daft (2007), organizational structure affects how power and resources are distributed and coordinated inside an organization. This study focuses on two constructs of formalization and centralization, and these two constructs were chosen for this study because they specifically define the structural characteristics of an organization (Kim and Shin, 2017). Additionally, it is asserted that the two constructs are crucial for estimating organizational outcomes at the employee level.

In centralized organizations, lower-level organizational members have less discretion to furnish suggestions and quickly respond to unique opportunities and innovate (Shafique et al., 2022). A centralized organizational structure is likely to reduce the empowering process of reverse mentoring on innovative performance. This is because, in an organization with centralized decision-making, employees have less autonomy to sustain reverse mentoring initiatives. Moreover, the level of formalization affects how employees communicate within organizations. The company's policies and procedures serve as a guide for workers' work roles and behavior in a formalized organization (Ben Zammel and Najar, 2022). It will have a negative effect on the consequences of reverse mentoring because formalized organizations constrain bottom-up knowledge-sharing behaviors such as reverse mentoring (Gonzalez, 2022). High formalization will weaken the psychologically empowering process of reverse mentoring on work outcomes. Therefore, this study argues that:

H4. Higher levels of formalization and centralization will negatively moderate the positive association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Participants and procedure

The study aims to examine these hypotheses in the Indian IT context, which is important for two reasons: first, India is the fifth largest economy in the world, and the gross domestic product contribution of the IT sector alone is 9% (ET Government, 2022). India's digital skilled pool has grown over the period, accounting for 75% of global digital talent. Second, following the jolt of the pandemic, India emerged as one of the biggest economies to bounce back, and particularly, the IT industry observed a boom with a growth of 15.5% in 2022 (Technology Sector in India 2022: Strategic Review | NASSCOM, 2022). Moreover, the IT industry is knowledge-intensive, requiring alternative practices of traditional mentoring that

are employee-driven and sustainable. Thus, these occupational characteristics of Indian IT employees provide a fertile research context for this study.

Purposive sampling was used for data collection via surveys administered to IT professionals in 11 IT firms in India. The heads of the project teams were contacted and requested to identify junior employees with a minimum of one year of work experience who were involved in the reverse mentoring relationship (i.e. mentored their senior colleagues). The inclusion criteria ensure that their experience accurately captures the job roles and work environment in which they were involved in frequent (both formal and informal) bottom-up knowledge transfer (not limited to technological challenges). The identified potential participants ( $n = 575$ ) were informed about the purpose of the study and were assured of non-disclosure regarding their personal information and/or company data. As data collection was carried out during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease of 2019) pandemic, online survey links were sent to the participants' email addresses, and they were asked for informed consent before participating in the study. A total of 382 usable responses were obtained for the analysis, yielding a response rate of 66.4%. The final sample consisted of 66% male and 34% female participants. Their average age was  $M = 28$  years ( $SD = 5.82$ ). Most held a bachelor's degree (50.3%) or postgraduate degree (47.1), with a small number having obtained a PhD (2.6%). The average work experience in their current organization was 3.5 years ( $SD = 4.02$ ).

### 4.2 Measures

The study used well-known scales, as their reliability and validity have already been established. Reverse mentoring was measured using the 11-item scale developed by *Garg et al.* (2021). Sample items included “I feel competent in the content that I share with my mentee (senior)” and “My mentee (senior) values the ideas and suggestions that I offer.” Employee resilience and agility were measured using a scale developed by *Braun et al.* (2017). Resilience sample items included, “I quickly adapt to new ways of doing things and/or new work assignments” and “I bounce back quickly when confronted with setbacks.” Agility sample items included, “I am always thinking about what we need to do differently to meet upcoming change,” and “I continuously work to understand what is going on in other areas to see if I need to make changes in what I’m doing.” The level of formalization and centralization of organizational structure was measured with items such as “Management in this organization does not seek inputs and feedbacks from employees in the process of making important decisions (R)” and “the workers are allowed no freedom to do their work in any way other than how they have been told to do it (R)” (*Alavi et al.*, 2014; *Kim and Shin, 2017*). To measure innovative performance, the nine-item scale by *Janssen* (2001) was used. Sample items included “Creating new ideas for difficult issues” and “Transforming innovative ideas into useful applications.” The responses for innovative performance were taken using a five-point Likert scale with anchors  $1 =$  “Never,” through to  $5 =$  “Always.” Consistent with the previous research, the study incorporated several control variables such as age, gender, work experience and education.

### 4.3 Common method bias

Harman's one-factor test was applied using SPSS to assess the possibility of the common method bias (CMB), and the percentage of variance explained was found to be 29.002%, which is below the recommended level, indicating that common method variance is not a problem (*Podsakoff et al.*, 2012). The method by *Bagozzi et al.* (1991) was followed in calculating the correlation among study variables, and as presented in Table 1, the highest correlation between any two constructs is 0.665. As the correlation among variables does not exceed 0.90, common method variance is not present (*Malik, 2022*). The multicollinearity of

research constructs was tested by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF), which was found to be less than 3.5 (Hair et al., 2016), suggesting multicollinearity was not the issue.

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Measurement model

Table 1 provides the loadings and reliability measures for each of the study's variables. Cronbach's (1951) alpha scores were found to be above 0.80 for all measures. Furthermore, composite reliability values ranged between 0.70 and 0.90 (Hair et al., 2016), which satisfied the prerequisite for construct reliability. Construct validity was also assessed by establishing convergent and discriminant validity. Conventionally, latent variables that had average variance extracted (AVE) values of greater than 0.50 were considered to have good convergent validity (Hair et al., 2016). The AVE value for reverse mentoring was found to be 0.47, which is slightly lower than the recommended value of 0.50. Especially when newly developed scales are used in social sciences, researchers have frequently obtained weaker outer loadings (<0.70) (Hulland, 1999). It is thus suggested that items with loading between 0.40 and 0.70 should be considered for removal if, upon deletion of the item, composite reliability and AVE value increase (Hair et al., 2016). Thus, items with outer loadings (<0.60) were dropped one by one, based on changes in AVE value and composite reliability, which significantly improved. After removing reverse mentoring items RM1 and RM2, with outer loadings less than 0.60, the AVE value was found to be greater than 0.50, thus suggesting convergent validity. In addition, the AVE values of all constructs were found to be greater than 0.50, suggesting adequate convergent validity (see Table 2). Standardized outer loadings were above the recommended value of 0.60, reconfirming good convergent validity

(Hair et al., 2016). As shown in Table 3, discriminant validity is based on the assessment of the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT), as ratios were below 0.85, indicating the presence of discriminant validity for all constructs (Hulland, 1999).

### 5.2 Structural model

To test the proposed hypotheses, a bootstrapping re-sampling procedure using 10,000 samples was carried out using partial least squares-structural equation modeling on SmartPLS, and the results are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1. Based on the analysis, *H1a* was supported, suggesting a significant positive association between reverse mentoring and employees' resilience ( $\beta = 0.239, p < 0.01$ ). Similarly, *H1b* was supported, suggesting that reverse mentoring positively influences employee agility ( $\beta = 0.294, p < 0.01$ ). As proposed in *H2b*, the association between agility and innovative performance was found to be significant ( $\beta = 0.687, p < 0.01$ ). On the other hand, the results of *H2a* suggest that the association between resilience and innovative performance was not significant ( $\beta = 0.087, p > 0.05$ ). The mediation hypotheses were tested following the mediation process framework of Zhao et al. (2010). First, the significance of the indirect effect through the mediator was assessed. The total effect of reverse mentoring on innovative performance ( $\beta = 0.223, p < 0.01$ ) through mediators and the direct effect ( $\beta = 0.372, p < 0.05$ ) were found to be significant. However, assessing the specific indirect effect in *H3a* suggests that resilience ( $\beta = 0.021, p > 0.05$ ) does not mediate the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance. Whereas results of *H3b* suggest that agility ( $\beta = 0.202, p < 0.01$ ) partially mediates the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance, as both the direct and indirect effects are significant. Moreover, the results of the moderation analysis *H4* suggest that the level of formalization and centralization of organizational structure negatively moderates the relationship of reverse mentoring on innovative performance, as the path coefficient was significant and negative ( $\beta = -0.095, p < 0.05$ ). This indicates that a high level of centralization and formalization weakens the positive relationship between reverse mentoring and innovative performance (Figure 2). The standardized root mean square residual for the model was 0.063, less than the 0.08 considered by Hu and Bentler (1998) to be a good fit. R-square values for IP were found to be 0.460, signifying that 46% of the variance was explained by the exogenous variables, respectively (Chin, 1998).

## 6. Discussion

This study demonstrated that incorporating nontraditional bottom-up knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring reinforces resilience and agility among employees, which further increases innovative performance. Past studies have emphasized and examined

the role of reverse mentoring in enhancing employee engagement and job performance and reducing turnover intentions, all of which are deemed relevant in the Indian IT sector (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Garg et al., 2021). This study extends the research in underscoring the relevance of reverse mentoring in creating a resilient and agile workforce, which is invaluable for survival and sustenance in today's IT sector (Gong and Ribiere, 2023; Kar, Yadav, and Panda, 2023). The study further advances the literature in demonstrating the direct and indirect effects of knowledge-sharing practices, such as reverse mentoring, in

enhancing innovative performance (Samie and Jazghani, 2022). In doing so, it contends that employee capabilities act as mediators in explaining the relationship between reverse mentoring and innovative performance.

The findings reveal that agility partially mediated the association of reverse mentoring with innovative performance. The result is aligned with the job demands and resources theory, wherein job resources foster personal resources in enhancing work outcomes. However, resilience did not mediate the association between reverse mentoring and innovative performance. A possible explanation for this is contingent upon the context in which the data was collected (Bailey and Breslin, 2021). As the data was collected during the pandemic, many people reported poor mental health, and languishing was named as the dominant emotion of those times (Grant, 2021). It is possible that participation in knowledge-sharing practices strengthened their resilience, but it did not translate into innovative performance due to the fact that they were languishing. We carried out a post hoc analysis to test the moderating effect of mental health on the association between personal resources (resilience and agility) and innovative performance. We found that mental health significantly moderated the association between resilience and innovative performance, whereas it did not moderate the association between agility and innovative performance. While mental health could be a possible factor in explaining the absence of a significant relationship, future studies need to reexamine these associations to gain confidence in establishing the association between resilience and innovative performance.

The majority of the literature on resilience and agility is either practitioner-oriented, lacking a solid theoretical foundation and empirical support, or industry-specific, focusing on the manufacturing sector (Gong and Ribiere, 2023; Junker *et al.*, 2022; Shweta *et al.*, 2023; Varshney, 2023). As a result, ways to foster employee resilience and agility in the context of IT remained empirically untested. Earlier investigations focused on low-to-moderate dynamic contexts (Cooke *et al.*, 2019), and implementing their findings in the Indian IT context is not without challenges. Thus, to stay relevant, innovative and competitive in the business and economic environment following the jolt of the COVID-19 pandemic, new workplace designs are required (Nagarajan *et al.*, 2022). However, implementing such practices in the Indian IT industry has many constraints, as culturally, India is considered to be high on power distance, and using bottom-up approaches such as reverse mentoring often requires employees to face cultural impediments of rigid hierarchy (Jammulamadaka, 2020; Sharma and Nambudiri, 2020), especially when reverse mentoring is not formally prescribed in the workplace. However, such practices will thrive in an organization with low formalization and decentralized decision-making, as demonstrated in the findings of this study. The findings of this study demonstrate that reverse mentoring aids employees' capabilities and innovative performance. However, only in a conducive environment with the right training and organizational support, reverse mentoring will be effective. Therefore, while implementing such bottom-up knowledge-sharing practices, a comprehensive strategy integrating developmental practices must be adopted.

## 7. Theoretical implications

The findings of our study contribute to the theoretical literature in two distinct ways. First, the existing literature on reverse mentoring predominantly focuses on job satisfaction, personal and career growth, engagement, etc. Though existing research underscores that being a mentor gives employees access to organizational knowledge and new ideas, empirical evidence regarding its influence on innovative performance remains unexplored. Examining this association is important as survival in times of rapid technological growth and advancement in the IT sector depends on innovative performance. Moreover, the underlying mechanism through which being a mentor in reverse mentoring exchange translates into performing innovatively requires further scrutiny. Therefore, the paper builds on the JD-R theory to explain the underlying psychological process through which reverse mentoring influences innovative performance. The paper demonstrates that reverse mentoring acts as a job resource and enhances innovative performance among mentors due to enhanced personal resources such as resilience and agility. This demonstrates the motivational process of the JD-R theory, wherein job resources aid personal resources, consequently enhancing the work outcome (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017). In doing so, we contribute to the literature on reverse mentoring by underscoring its importance in developing employees' personal resources and innovative performance.

Second, the data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic provides valuable insights into the current body of research, which has thus far overlooked the inclusion of uncertainty and volatility in examining the critical qualities necessary for thriving and enduring in the contemporary work landscape. While both researchers and practitioners underscored the role of resilience and agility as necessary capabilities for survival and sustenance during the pandemic, earlier studies were primarily carried out in not-so-dynamic or volatile contexts (Kuntz *et al.*, 2017; Tonkin *et al.*, 2018; Doeze Jager-van Vliet *et al.*, 2019; Wei *et al.*, 2020). Evidence collected during the pandemic reinforces the importance of resilience and agility that can be developed by knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring. Furthermore, researchers recommended the integration of reverse mentoring into human

resource management practices for employee development (Jayathilake et al., 2021). This study examined this proposition and explored the influence of reverse mentoring on resilience and agility. All in all, the findings of the study fill the research gap about the underlying mechanism explaining the effect of reverse mentoring on innovative performance in Indian IT professionals and enrich the theoretical aspects entailing the interaction of job and personal resources with innovative performance.

## 8. Practical implications

This study offers several practical implications. While resilience and agility have been the center of managerial discussion and industry reports, as they are deemed essential for a post-pandemic world, this paper goes forward to offer important insights into how these capabilities can be developed in the work context. Knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring is gaining prominence among Indian IT employees as economic tools for organizations both in terms of costs and resources (Garg et al., 2021; Lei et al., 2021). Chaudhuri et al. (2021) note that the paucity of formal implementation of reverse mentoring restricts its access to real-time data, which is why academicians are slow to jump on this bandwagon while the world of practice values it immensely. This study further provides empirical evidence regarding the significant role of these practices in building personal resources and enhancing innovative performance, especially in the Indian IT context where high power distance is prevalent (Jammulamadaka, 2020). In India, companies such as EY (e.g. GenWHY), Merck, Mercer, P&G and Honeywell Technology Solutions have revamped their reverse mentoring programs due to their benefit in learning and development, adoption of emerging technologies and for creating an inclusive multigenerational workforce (Economic Times, 2023). Companies are advised to take the initiative to encourage both mentors and mentees to participate in reverse mentoring to enhance innovative performance. The mentors can be rewarded and recognized for their contribution to entering a reverse mentoring relationship. At the same time, organizations can create an inclusive and safe working environment to ensure learning for the mentees, such that new ideas are generated, shared and implemented.

Most importantly, our research indicates that implementing reverse mentoring helps boost innovative performance by enhancing employees' personal resources. Thus, to reap positive work outcomes in today's uncertain and volatile work environment, organizational effort needs to be directed toward promoting and supporting employee-initiated practices. As Browne (2021) notes, by 2025, Millennials and Gen Z will comprise 75% of the workforce, who value mentoring opportunities and, through interactions with senior leaders, seek to fulfill their strong desire for feedback, reduce career-related anxiety, be noticed and seen in the organization (Jayathilake et al., 2021). Moreover, as the IT sector rapidly changes and is driven by technological transformations, organizations can use the expertise of the younger generation to train the workforce in a cost-effective manner. Recent research from India underscores that in the post-COVID era, firms require agility and resilience in their employees for innovative work behavior (Sengupta et al., 2023). By acting as a mentor in the reverse mentoring association, young professionals can gain insights that can make them more resilient and agile, consequently boosting their innovative performance.

The findings of the study, therefore, hold value for IT professionals in implementing and encouraging reverse mentoring. In addition, our finding informs HR leaders and decision-makers that merely implementing reverse mentoring practices may not result in optimal employee outcomes unless the level of formalization and centralization can accommodate such bottom-up approaches. As indicated by the GLOBE project, non-Western cultures often prioritize hierarchical structures and traditional mentorship models, which can be

challenging in implementing reverse mentoring initiatives (Harshani *et al.*, 2024). This mandates the need for empirical research investigating when the bottom-up approach of knowledge sharing can be successfully implemented in the organization. This study's findings suggest that structure should be less formal and that decision-making should be decentralized. This can encourage employees to share their knowledge and prove an effective method of establishing cross-generational relationships at the workplace. Therefore, leaders and managers should focus on knowledge-sharing practices and appropriate structures for innovative performance to remain relevant in the new reality of the post-pandemic.

## 9. Limitations and recommendations for future research

Our study does have limitations. First, the cross-sectional research data precluded any causal inference. Future studies can incorporate a dyadic approach and use a longitudinal study design to gauge the change in attitude and performance of both the mentors and the mentees. The study is rooted in the JD-R theory, which enriches the understanding of reverse mentoring as a job resource. However, the study is limited by its narrow scope to focus on examining the association of reverse mentoring with employees' resilience, agility and innovative performance. Future studies can benefit from a broader focus by using the resource-based view, knowledge management theory and social capital theory. To establish causality and understand the dynamic nature of relationships over time, future researchers are encouraged to use longitudinal and experimental study designs.

Second, our results could be susceptible to CMBs, as all measures were self-reported by participants. However, we adopted the necessary procedural and statistical remedies to control distortion in the sample, and Harman's one-factor test was applied to assess the possibility of the CMB, and the percentage of variance explained was found to be 29.002%, which is below the recommended level (Podsakoff *et al.*, 2012). Moreover, the study falls prey to sampling bias as it draws from IT firms that are high-performing and have established reverse mentoring programs. The findings of this study can, therefore, not be generalized to other IT firms that have not yet implemented the reverse mentoring program. The inherent challenges of the same can be studied in future research. In future studies, the mediating variable can be separated in time, and individual performance can be obtained from supervisor-rated measures to minimize the detrimental effects of the method bias and response shift bias (Podsakoff *et al.*, 2012).

The current study only controls for demographic variables; however, future research can consider the role of confounding variables such as personality traits, learning styles and prior experience with mentoring. Future research could also explore the role of power dynamics in reverse mentoring relationships, examining how hierarchical differences may influence knowledge-sharing and learning outcomes. Moreover, the role of culture that prioritizes collaboration, innovation and inclusivity in enhancing the impact of reverse mentoring can be studied. Future studies can also explore the role of contextual factors such as organizational culture, leadership support and industry dynamics can provide a nuanced understanding regarding the effectiveness of reverse mentoring for innovative performance.

As the relationship between resilience and innovative performance was found to be insignificant, future research can re-examine these associations in the post-pandemic context. Moreover, the role of probable confounding variables can be examined in studying these associations. While this study examined the outcomes of reverse mentoring for the mentor, future studies can investigate the dyadic nature of these outcomes. Finally, conditions under which reverse mentoring can build personal resources for participants can be examined to gain confidence regarding its role in fostering capabilities for survival and sustenance in today's work environment.

## 10. Conclusion

Drawing on the JD-R theory, this study revealed that reverse mentoring positively relates to employee capabilities such as resilience and agility. Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic provides unique insights into the benefits of bottom-up approaches to knowledge sharing to facilitate innovative performance through fostering resilience and agility capabilities. The findings suggest reverse mentoring can be mutually gainful as it benefits the employees as well as the organizations. However, to enhance the effectiveness of such practices, the structure should be aligned with lower levels of formalization and centralization. The paper holds implications for managers to implement knowledge-sharing practices such as reverse mentoring to develop employee capabilities (i.e. resilience and agility) and innovative performance.
