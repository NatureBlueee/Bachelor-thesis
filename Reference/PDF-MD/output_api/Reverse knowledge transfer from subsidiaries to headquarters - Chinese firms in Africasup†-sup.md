## ABSTRACT

This study aims to identify the factors influencing the reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) of local market information from overseas subsidiaries to their multinational enterprise (MNE) headquarters. For this objective, this study uses both knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital as overarching theoretical concepts. Survey data are collected from Chinese MNEs operating in Africa, which is often referred to as an unknown 'blue ocean' economy. Results show that the components (i.e., knowledge development capabilities and possession of prior relevant knowledge) of knowledge transfer capacity increase relational capital. Specifically, knowledge development capabilities highly facilitate the overseas subsidiaries' RKT, and relational capital functions as a vehicle promoting such phenomenon. Findings can provide valuable theoretical contributions and practical implications to MNEs intending to enter 'blue ocean' markets.

## 1. Introduction

Knowledge has been identified as a crucial strategic resource to compete in the global marketplace (Lyles and Salk, 1996; Liu et al., 2010; Rabboisi and Santangelo, 2013; Tseng, 2015). In addition, adequate knowledge management through internationalization is considered a critical source of multinational enterprise (MNE) competitiveness (Froese et al., 2021; Ghauri et al., 2021). Knowledge is intended for transfer both ways, from the parent units or headquarters (i.e., MNEs) to their subsidiaries, and vice versa (Buckley et al., 2014; McGuinness et al., 2013; Park, 2011; Reilly et al., 2023). However, empirical examinations of knowledge management have mainly focused on headquarters transferring their knowledge/technology to their overseas subsidiaries. Previous studies (e.g., Lyles and Salk, 1996; Park and Choi, 2014; Park et al., 2022) argue that the knowledge transferred from MNEs to subsidiaries helps the latter compete in the local market. Without such knowledge, subsidiaries tend to face difficulties in accomplishing their mission within the MNE network (Nair et al., 2018).

Given these findings, few scholars have considered reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) from subsidiaries to the headquarters of MNEs despite the latter not only disseminating knowledge to but also acquiring knowledge from their subsidiaries to become more innovative and competitive (Ho et al., 2019; Johanson and Vahlne, 2006). Moreover, the circumstances under which knowledge transfer, particularly RKT, takes place remain unknown, even though recent literature has explored the role of certain factors, such as organizational ambidexterity and innovation (Borini et al., 2022) or repatriates (Froese et al., 2021). With these limitations, the interactions among internationalization, learning, and headquarters capability enhancement based on RKT also remain largely unclear (Chiva et al., 2014; Li and Lee, 2015). How relational capital influences the knowledge transfer behaviors of overseas subsidiaries also warrants further study (Singh et al., 2021).

The knowledge transfer between MNE headquarters and subsidiaries is an important research topic in the International Business (IB) domain (Alharbi and Singh, 2013). However, the mainstream literature has concentrated on knowledge transfers from parent firms to subsidiaries (Vahlne and Johanson, 2014; Park, 2012), and not vice versa. Due to this, despite its growing importance to the knowledge generation of MNEs, the literature on RKT is still in its infancy (Li et al., 2016; Tseng, 2015). However, scholars gradually pay particular attention to the fact that the subsidiaries increasingly contribute to the MNEs' value creation through RKT (Chung, 2014; Ciabuschi et al., 2015). In this circumstance, relational capital is a network of relationships between MNE headquarters and their subsidiaries within the MNE network environment. Relational capital is based on the emotional characteristics of knowledge transfers and acquirers, and the relational capital is often promoted by communications and interactions. Therefore, the relational capital is composed of confidence and trust. In this vein, the relational capital builds favorable knowledge flow environments, which indicates why RKT and relational capital are important to be studied.

In addition, another noticeable fact is that to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has explored the Chinese MNEs' absorption of knowledge that is reversely transferred by overseas subsidiaries. While literature has comprehensively examined knowledge transfer between American and European firms, the internationalization of MNEs from emerging markets (EM)—particularly from China—has recently received increasing attention (Su et al., 2020). The knowledge-seeking investments by multinationals from EM to advanced economies have also been explored (Fu et al., 2018). Chinese MNEs have been highly active in their internationalization efforts and in acquiring knowledge from foreign firms and markets, and thus accumulated a large amount of internationally exploitable knowledge (Athreya et al., 2016). However, Chinese MNE investments in Africa remain largely unknown despite the speculations surrounding their motives and benefits.

Scholars and practitioners have long concentrated on global trade and investment within North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2021, the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Africa reached a record \$83 billion, an increase of 112.8% from \$39 billion in 2020 (UNCTAD, 2022b). However, these statistics fail to show that, apart from South Africa, the share of African countries in global trade and investment is almost negligible (White et al., 2023). This finding reversely implies that compared with North America, Europe, and Asia, Africa remains an unknown 'blue ocean' economy for international business activities though MNEs need to explore its local market information (LMI) to understand the direction of their future business. With this objective, the present study investigates the RKT from Chinese subsidiaries established in Africa to their MNEs in China.

Africa is home to one-sixth of the global population and has experienced the fastest growth in the world over the past couple of decades (UNCTAD, 2022a). Accordingly, MNEs show increasing interest in doing business in Africa given the huge opportunities it offers to multinationals; however, investing in Africa remains a challenge (Adomako et al., 2019; Asongu et al., 2019; Nachum et al., 2022). Africa has distinct resources and capabilities (Cunha and Putnam, 2019) that MNEs must learn about to enhance their competitive position not only in Africa but also worldwide. The difficulties and complexities involved in transferring knowledge between MNEs and their overseas subsidiaries have been explored (Fu et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2019; Zander and Kogut, 1995), but research on the factors associated with the roles of knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital remains in its infancy. As such, this study uses both knowledge transfer and relational capital as overarching theoretical lenses to identify their effects on RKT, specifically in the African market.

This study offers four contributions. First, by closing the aforementioned research gaps, this study theoretically enhances the current understanding of the key factors that influence the RKT between Chinese firms and their African subsidiaries/activities. As mentioned above, the components of knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital have been largely ignored. However, knowledge transfer between organizations becomes restricted when the teaching firms have limited capabilities (i.e., knowledge transfer capacity) and when their mutual relationships (i.e., relational capital) are not conducive. Following this premise, this study sheds light on the de facto function of the theoretical breeds and empirically examines the true role of these elements in RKT discussions. To be honest, a welcome exception (Oh and Anchor, 2017) explores the effects of both knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital on RKT; but focused only on their causal relationship. By contrast, the uniqueness of this study lies in the addition of a precious milestone to the previous examination and considers the *mediating influence of relational capital in the relationship between knowledge transfer capacity and RKT* (emphasis added) and the interaction effects of its key factors. This study strengthens the theoretical understanding on knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital. In other words, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that examines whether relational capital mediates in the association between the capacity of a knowledge transferor and the extent to which a recipient receives the knowledge, and new research that concentrates on interactions between determinants of RKT. Thus, this topic is worthy of investigation and the findings are unique and important, eventually offering valuable implications for MNE competitiveness and growth.

Second, this study offers several clues as to whether RKT follows the same pattern wherever an MNE subsidiary is established or whether capability-based and relation-specific factors differ from one location to another. These clues can enrich the current understanding of the roles of knowledge development capability, possession of prior relevant knowledge, and relational capital as inputs for internationalization and subsequent knowledge management within MNE networks (Petersen et al., 2008). Third, Chinese MNEs

acquire knowledge and enhance their capabilities via RKT from their subsidiaries in developed countries (Athreya et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2018), but whether or not they acquire LMI from their African investments presents an interesting research avenue. Exploring this topic can augment the prevalent research trajectory of subsidiary-driven learning theory (Almeida and Phene, 2004). Fourth, by checking whether tacit knowledge (i.e., LMI) can be transferred to headquarters, this study confirms whether knowledge transfer follows a one- or two-way traffic. Even the tacit knowhow of the head office can be learned by its subsidiaries (Park, 2010). In this case, exploring whether the LMI that is culturally embedded in the local market can be simultaneously transmitted to MNE headquarters may yield interesting insights. Such research is particularly relevant for investments in Africa and may even encourage MNEs from countries other than China to invest in this region.

## 2. African market: the unknown 'blue ocean'

The African continent has historically received less FDI than other emerging economies or developing regions. Since 2010, Africa only accounts for 3.4% of the global inward FDI while Asia accounts for 28% (UNCTAD, 2022b). As FDI flows into the Chinese market, the competition between MNEs and local firms has intensified. Accordingly, various industries in China have transformed into a ferocious battlefield between major global manufacturers and their local counterparts. As a result, the rate of return on foreign investments is gradually decreasing in several sectors. Two firms that are negatively affected by such competitions are Hyundai Motors and Kia, which only sold 151,703 cars in China out of their 1,142,016 global sales in 2016 (The Kyunghyang Shinmun, 2022). This example may imply that many economies that have caught the attention of MNEs have transformed into mature markets. By contrast, the African market has yet to see active FDI, which paradoxically suggests that the region may become a magnet for new foreign investments and an attractive 'blue ocean' that can provide future growth potential for MNEs.

Africa is undeniably abundant in natural resources and raw materials, which many countries clearly aim to obtain through FDI to support their key and high-tech industries, such as semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, and aircrafts (Feulefack and Ngassam, 2020). In addition, Africa has a population of 1.3 billion, but its wages are among the lowest in the world (Eurostat, 2022). Moreover, the Chief Economist of the United Nations Development Program Africa points out that African countries are to become the most attractive FDI destinations in the near future (Odusola, 2018).

Despite its considerable potential, the African market remains relatively unknown to foreign investors compared with other regions. MNEs that have entered African countries often face considerable difficulties in adapting to the local market and avoiding natural selection mainly due to their lack of information (Glaister et al., 2020). To overcome these disadvantages or reduce the liability of foreignness, MNE headquarters acquire, accumulate, and utilize information that is only available in their host countries (Zaheer, 1995). Therefore, RKT from overseas subsidiaries is probably the most effective channel through which MNE headquarters obtain idiosyncratic information on foreign local markets. We present our theoretical focus in Fig. 1.

## 3. Theoretical concepts and hypotheses development

### 3.1. Knowledge transfer capacity

The extent of knowledge transfer/RKT is commonly determined by using three dimensions, namely, the learning organization's absorptive capacity, the teacher firm's knowledge transfer capacity, and their mutual relationships (i.e., relational capital). As mentioned in the Introduction, although the role of absorptive capacity have been explored for decades (e.g., Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Lane and Lubatkin, 1998; Ortega-Gutiérrez et al., 2022; Park, 2010; Park and Ghauri, 2011), knowledge transfer capacity is considered new. Knowledge transfer capacity represents the ability of a firm to articulate the uses of its own knowledge, assess the needs of a potential recipient, and transmit knowledge so that the recipient can use it in another location (Kuiken and van der Sijde, 2011). Following the seminal work of Martin and Salomon (2003), Park (2011) has recently extended the theoretical concept of knowledge transfer capacity as a new entity and argued for its pivotal role in initiating learning (p. 76). According to Park (2011), knowledge transfer/RKT is often difficult and presents a major managerial challenge. Specifically, the tacit characteristics of knowledge complicate its transfer across organizational boundaries. In this onerous situation, RKT can be efficiently realized when absorptive capacity is harmonized with a teacher firm's knowledge transfer capacity, that is, to facilitate the outflow of its own knowledge, to instruct the recipient firm to acquire information aborted or accumulated in the knowledge reservoir, and to facilitate knowledge application at the recipient firm.

However, Najafi-Tavani et al. (2023) warn that knowledge uncertainties can occur when information asymmetry persists between collaborative organizations (e.g., headquarters and overseas subsidiaries). High levels of knowledge uncertainties not only considerably harm such relationships but also lead to role conflict and ambiguity. In addition, the poor capability of the teacher firm can have adverse effects on the quality of knowledge flow and learning in any collaborative relationship. Meanwhile, Oh and Anchor (2017) argue that, as parts of MNEs' collaborative networks, overseas subsidiaries can access diverse local resources and learn local knowledge about their host countries. In this case, the accumulating ex ante knowledge (e.g., possession of prior relevant knowledge) and internal characteristics (e.g., knowledge development capabilities) of these subsidiaries can influence the extent to which they share knowledge with MNEs (Joao et al., 2011). An important foundation of the competitiveness of MNEs may stem from the ability of subsidiaries to understand, develop, and transfer local knowledge, which can create competitive advantages that are previously unavailable to these firms (i.e., MNEs). In addition, subsidiaries may choose not to share the new information they have learned to their headquarters due to insufficient knowledge transfer capacity (Park, 2011). Subsidiaries need to adapt and refine local knowledge, and as a result, knowledge transfer (i.e., RKT to headquarters) is significantly influenced by the extent to which the learning units (i.e., subsidiaries) in local markets can imbibe the acquired information and develop it for their own purposes. These abilities comprise the knowledge transmission capability of the sender (Tang et al., 2010). In other words, for RKT, subsidiaries (i.e., teaching firms) should have the development capability to transform tacit to explicit knowledge and own prior relevant experiences to adequately assess a recipient's capability and deliver the key information in the knowledge reservoir. In summary, knowledge transfer capacity determines the potential volume of RKT and consists of two facets, namely, a subsidiaries' capability to develop the acquired information and its existing knowledge base. We outline our conceptual framework in Fig. 2.

### 3.2. Relational capital

Discussions on RKT should also consider the relational capital between headquarters and their subsidiaries. Relational capital refers to the individual and/or organizational relationships that are developed via close and frequent interactions, and thus facilitating mutual understandings and resolving unnecessary conflicts (Yan et al., 2019). For MNEs, relational capital refers to organizational elements that maintain favorable headquarters-subsidiary relationships. By doing so, relational capital improves the extent of their

The framework shows three main components influencing Reverse Knowledge Transfer:

- Possession of Prior Relevant Knowledge (bottom center)

collaboration, thereby increasing the probability of inter-organizational knowledge exchange (Oh et al., 2016). These strong relationships are thus a conduit for their mutual socialization, such as frequent communications and efficient transmission channels. Intense organizational interactions based on a sense of intimacy accelerate knowledge sharing by enhancing the coordination capabilities of both parties.

Relational capital is also associated with trust relationships between knowledge transferring and learning organizations (Borini et al., 2012). Heterogeneities in language, culture, business schemes, and psychic distance may decelerate the development of relational capital between MNEs and subsidiaries. As an underlying relational capital, trust provides an efficient and effective basis for knowledge flow (Park, 2010) given its key role in deterring opportunistic behavior and in maintaining an open mind. Therefore, by laying the foundation for relational capital, trust often saves transaction costs and time for screening and recognizing the perceived value of the transferred knowledge (Ho et al., 2018). Moreover, the success of MNEs in the global marketplace considerably depends on its effective management of relationships with its subsidiaries, and this argument clearly points out the value of relational capital for MNE headquarters. The effects of relational capital on RKT from subsidiaries to headquarters and the corresponding empirical evidence are further discussed during the hypothesis development.

### 3.3. Knowledge development capabilities and relational capital

For subsidiaries, knowledge development capabilities enable them to uncover and embed new information for achieving company-wide innovation. This knowledge learned also helps them outperform their competitors in local markets and other subsidiaries established by multinational rivalries. Through upward transfer, such knowledge may also be used by MNE headquarters to supplement their organizational weaknesses. Thus, the knowledge held by subsidiaries can influence their power (Kong et al., 2018) and help them make independent decisions related to the acquisition and development of new, innovative LMI. Knowledge development in subsidiaries is crucial because RKT is not merely a movement of knowledge from one organization to another but rather its adaptation and modification in different organizational and socio-cultural contexts (Choi and Johanson, 2012). Given its peculiarity, RKT can be seen as systematic transportation of location-bound assets in host countries to MNE headquarters (Nair et al., 2018). Yang et al. (2008) argued that during the RKT, the transferring unit must recreate and maintain a complex, causally ambiguous set of routines in a new setting. The ability to perform such task is defined as knowledge development capability.

Literature on headquarters–subsidiaries power relationships (Ghauri and Park, 2012; Kong et al., 2018; Najafi-Tavani et al., 2015) reveal that knowledge is frequently transferred from headquarters, who are armed with advanced technology and know-how, to their subsidiaries. Therefore, the power typically resides in the headquarters. However, RKT facilitated by the knowledge development capabilities of subsidiaries can increase their power in two ways (Najafi-Tavani et al., 2015). First, the recurrent transfer of LMI serves as a source per se of power for subsidiaries. Second, the knowledge resources of subsidiaries are mostly tacit due to being locally specific information. Therefore, subsidiaries should not only transform such tacit information in their organizational practices and employee experiences and skills into explicit knowledge but also build their own capability to check whether the LMI can be applied to the current knowledge of their MNEs. For these reasons, the headquarters' recognition of the knowledge development capabilities of their subsidiaries is directly linked to subsidiary power (Ambos et al., 2010), which may motivate their socialization and enhance their relational capital (Najafi-Tavani et al., 2012). In other words, subsidiaries gradually become visible to their headquarters by improving their knowledge development capabilities, which can subsequently increase their relational capital. Similarly, Jeong et al. (2017) assert that knowledge development capabilities can serve as structural collaborative connectors. As such, with extraordinary capabilities in discerning, cultivating, and embedding locally specialized information to prepare them for potential RKT, subsidiaries tend to interact with their headquarters (i.e., develop social capital). The following hypothesis is then proposed:

**Hypothesis 1.** Subsidiaries' knowledge development capabilities have positive influence on the relational capital between headquarters and subsidiaries.

### 3.4. Possession of prior relevant knowledge and relational capital

Ghauri and Park (2012) suggest that when MNEs seek a local partner or potential collaborator who pursues similar interests, the top management in MNEs should check for similar relevant knowledge. If so, MNEs have no need to experiment on their cooperation. Ghauri and Park (2012) also advise that ownership of relevant knowledge helps these firms understand one another, thereby increasing the probability for an MNE to successfully launch corporate activities even in unfamiliar environments. Having previous related knowledge may increase the interaction among cognitive structures of collaborative enterprises, build their intimacy and strengthen their bonds, and serve as a catalyst for their socialization, thereby increasing their relational capital. Such assumption is plausible in that the relevance of in-house information between collaborative entities can help them understand and circulate their existing knowledge stock, thereby allowing for a mutual recognition of their organizational resource reservoir and eventually lead to a feeling of homogeneity (Daghfous, 2004).

This assumption has also been confirmed in empirical literature. van Veen (2018) contends that collaboration is largely a function of the right organization being in the right market at the right time. Here, “right organization” refers to firms that are willing to work together toward a jointly defined goal and their counterparts that possess previous relevant knowledge and experience. Collaborations also inspire interactions within networks, develop friendly relations and mutual trust, encourage the reduction of organizational distance (e.g., cultural estrangement, psychic distance, and goal heterogeneity), and enhance relational capital in cooperative relations, including headquarter–subsidiary relationships (Najafi-Tavani et al., 2012). Similarly, Nair et al. (2018) suggest that having

relevant experience and applicable knowledge may directly influence socialization and build the confidence of firms to engage in reciprocal activities that accelerate their pursuit of common interests and increase their relational capital. Prieto-Pastor et al. (2018) also highlight that having similar knowledge and skills in their repository allows for collaborative firms (e.g., headquarters and subsidiaries) to improve their understanding and share experiences on how to work together, thus stimulating mutual trust and increasing relational capital. The following hypothesis is then proposed.

**Hypothesis 2.** Subsidiaries' possession of prior relevant knowledge with MNEs positively increases the relational capital between headquarters and subsidiaries.

### 3.5. Knowledge development capabilities and reverse knowledge transfer

Claver-Cortes et al. (2018) argue that MNEs need to continuously learn new knowledge and local information to better understand and cope with ever-changing market conditions. Moreover, MNEs should not work on such effort on their own and rather should also collect local information through their subsidiaries. MNEs often use FDIs as a means to gain foreign knowledge that is deeply embedded in the local market and then use RKT to combine with its own and strengthen its competitive advantage (Chung, 2014). As such, overseas subsidiaries should have unique capabilities to recognize, absorb, and further develop new external information for competitive means (Berry, 2015; Claver-Cortes et al., 2018). These subsidiaries may then transfer the knowledge they developed to their headquarters, who can then use such knowledge to sustain their competitive advantage and increase their global market share. In summary, for MNEs to acquire LMI through RKT, their foreign subsidiaries should be able to develop knowledge for transference (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000).

These arguments have been corroborated in previous studies. Jeong et al. (2017) argue that the knowledge development capabilities of subsidiaries are prerequisites for their RKT to their headquarters and that such transmittance can only be possible when the former is capable of properly codifying such local knowledge (i.e., proper knowledge development capabilities). Similarly, Martins (2012) states that the starting line for RKT is the subsidiaries' successful development of knowledge from local markets. Oh and Anchor (2017) report that several subsidiaries can enhance the value of their own knowledge by acquiring and developing new local information, and this knowledge they develop and transfer is used by their headquarters MNEs to compete with rivals in the global market. Najafi-Tavani et al. (2015) argue that subsidiaries primarily develop knowledge through their interactions with local customers, suppliers, and other organizations and that their development capabilities highly determine the volume of reversely transferred knowledge (e.g., local practices for marketing and LMI) to headquarters. The following hypothesis is then proposed:

**Hypothesis 3.** Subsidiaries' knowledge development capabilities positively influence their reverse knowledge transfer to headquarters.

### 3.6. Possession of prior relevant knowledge and reverse knowledge transfer

Subsidiaries' LMI that is transferred through RKT is crucial for MNEs to achieve competitive advantages. To carry out the transfer, subsidiaries need the capability of identifying and obtaining such knowledge in local markets. However, these subsidiaries encounter many motivational and perceptive obstacles in the RKT (Cepeda-Carriona et al., 2016). For instance, their employees may resist the acquisition of new external information—when it is not related to their prior knowledge—from other groups, firms, or institutions (Chang et al., 2012). The same logic can be applied to the knowledge exchange between subsidiaries and MNEs, that is, subsidiaries can easily gain and deliver LMI to MNEs when they have prior knowledge and similar knowledge base (Jeong et al., 2017). Compared with other types of knowledge (e.g., technology), LMI has more tacit and adhesion characteristics (Subramaniam and Venkatraman, 2001; Szulanski, 1996), which explains its difficulty to move smoothly from one firm to another; thus, the RKT from subsidiaries to MNEs increases in complexity (Crespo et al., 2014; Najafi-Tavani et al., 2015). This problem can be addressed when the teaching and learning organizations share the same cognitive structure, that is, the same basis of previous knowledge (Barakat et al., 2022). For the knowledge transferor, a relevant organizational knowledge base represents “the level of familiarity and comfort in a certain area” (Park, 2011: 79), which predetermines its capability to transmit locally embedded information and enhances its confidence in teaching.

The above arguments have been empirically confirmed by Monteiro et al. (2007), who find that two organizational units sharing parallel backgrounds and experiences tend to actively interact and transfer knowledge compared with non-similar units. Foss and Pedersen (2002) also reveal the importance of having prior relevant knowledge, which can improve the information exchange between MNEs and their subsidiaries and exerts a huge effect on RKT. Similarly, Ishihara and Zolkiewski (2017) and Barakat et al. (2022) suggest that although “knowledge stickiness” often prohibits MNEs from learning new information from subsidiaries, the latter’s possession of prior relevant knowledge can help the former successfully acquire new information. Park (2011) supports such argument by contending that the relevant knowledge of subsidiaries can contribute to their MNEs’ knowledge repository by effectively delivering fresh information. McGuinness et al. (2013) lend further support by arguing that the ability to reversely convey new information by retaining a relevant knowledge base is one of subsidiaries’ primary sources of competitiveness that helps them communicate and exchange with their headquarters (i.e., headquarters provide sophisticated technology, whereas subsidiaries offer information on the new host environment). The following hypothesis is then proposed:

**Hypothesis 4.** Subsidiaries' possession of prior relevant knowledge positively influences their reverse knowledge transfer to their headquarters.

### 3.7. Relational capital and reverse knowledge transfer

MNEs often establish overseas subsidiaries to acquire idiosyncratic information that is not available internally (Castro and Moreira, 2023; Chung, 2014; Jiménez-Jiménez et al., 2019; Najafi-Tavani et al., 2012); however, these subsidiaries may choose not to transfer knowledge to their headquarters to retain their power (Kong et al., 2018). Therefore, MNEs need to inaugurate special mechanisms in which improved relations (i.e., relational capital) with their subsidiaries is crucial (Khoirunnisa and Almahendra, 2021). MNEs can enhance their relational capital by using various conduits, such as socialization mechanisms, establishing mutual trust between organizations, and shared values that are designed to create business solutions to social and environmental problems (Oh and Anchor, 2017).

The positive effect of relational capital on RKT has been previously emphasized. Shaw and Luiz (2018) identify relational capital (e.g., trust) as a key driver that increases the effectiveness of knowledge exchange between firms and reduces the needed effort to protect one's own knowledge by improving their relationship. Ho et al. (2018) argue that trust encourages teaching firms to assist learning ones to receive and understand the knowledge without hesitation. As a result, relational capital plays a pivotal role in promoting knowledge flow across organizational boundaries. Moreover, Crespo et al. (2014) and Morgulis-Yakushev et al. (2018) argue that relational capital strengthens the emotional ties between knowledge transferring and acquiring firms (also see Nair et al., 2018), especially when exchanging culture-bound knowledge such as LMI. Moreover, especially in MNE networks, relational capital refers to firm-specific relationships that they develop with other subsidiaries. As such, RKT by subsidiaries may not be plausible in the absence of learning environments that promote relational capital (Jeong et al., 2017), which is therefore confirmed as critical in executing the transfer. The following hypothesis is then proposed:

**Hypothesis 5.** A sufficient stock of relational capital between headquarters and subsidiaries positively influences the latter's reverse knowledge transfer to the former.

### 3.8. Mediating role of relational capital

Relational capital captures the quality of business relationship between two organizations at a certain point in time (Oh et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2019). In particular, relational capital in MNE networks may consist of cognitive trust and emotional feelings between headquarters and overseas subsidiaries. In each organization, the high level of cognitive trust and positive emotions point out their sense of closeness and intimacy (Chen and Peng, 2008). High relational capital indicates that employees commonly receive collaborative mutual support and actively communicate with each other (Park, 2011). As such, a high relational capital increases the subsidiaries' willingness to use of organizational resources, which headquarters want to use to further strengthen their competitiveness (Park, 2011). By contrast, subsidiaries with a low relational capital and lack of support from their headquarters may face difficulties to accomplish organizational objectives, such as RKT (Oh and Anchor, 2017). Thus, relational capital, as a representation of the organizational relationship at a certain time, is logically an operationalized concept of how many resources are available in teacher-learners relationships, and to what extent subsidiaries allocate resources to enable RKT. Again, relational capital may help headquarters gain a competitive edge and efficiently obtain information from subsidiaries (Oh and Anchor, 2017). As a resource that can increase the volume of RKT, relational capital can also be seen as a means to improve knowledge transfer capacity in that students cannot learn without teachers' appropriate teaching capability (Martin and Salomon, 2003). In other words, subsidiaries that lack the capability for transferring knowledge that headquarters eagerly hope to learn, show a gradual decline of relational capital, which again lessens RKT. The possible reasons are as follows. First, subsidiaries' knowledge transfer capacity indicates their ability to effectively transform tacit to explicit knowledge, convincingly articulate it, and spread it in a way that headquarters can accurately understand (Law and Chan, 2016). Second, headquarters are motivated to maintain close relationships with subsidiaries that are perceived as precious and invaluable in their networks and are clearly positioned 'in the loop of information' (Kong et al., 2018). This process reinforces their relationship resources, thereby increasing their relational capital. Third, given the cognitive organizational trust and good emotional feeling, headquarters can easily identify the source of the knowledge, grasp it, and tactically put the learning into practice (Mu et al., 2010). In addition, the increase in the relational capital caused by knowledge transfer capacity eventually boosts RKT. The following hypothesis is then proposed:

**Hypothesis 6.** Relational capital mediates the positive influence of knowledge transfer capacity on reverse knowledge transfer.

## 4. Data and methods

### 4.1. Sample and data collection

To test the above hypotheses, we carried out an empirical analysis using data collected from Chinese MNEs owning foreign subsidiaries in Africa. The data were obtained by using a survey at the beginning of 2023. China presents an ideal setting for empirical testing of the proposed model. As the second-largest economy behind the United States (US) (in terms of nominal GDP) and the largest emerging economy in the world, China has quickly transformed itself into a global economic superpower in the recent decades (Park and Xiao, 2021). China's outward FDI is rapidly expanding due to the 'going out' strategy implemented by the government to encourage Chinese firms to invest abroad. Since 2010, China remains the largest FDI investor in Africa, which is the third-largest funds destination. Data from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that Chinese investment stocks in Africa grew from 210 million US dollars in 2000 to >47.4 billion dollars by the end of 2020 and spread to >50 African countries. Meanwhile, a new report on the

**Swiss–African Business Relations Status Quo 2021** reveals that China plays an increasingly important role in driving the economic development of Africa and ranks the largest source of FDI in the region over the last decade in terms of new jobs created. While Chinese firms have presented considerable contributions to improving the social stability, industrialization, and economic prosperity of Africa by transferring valuable and advanced technology. Foreign expansion in the region also allows Chinese firms to access and learn idiosyncratic local market knowledge and information from different sources and then transfer such learning back home or to their other subsidiaries. Thus, Africa may present key research and learning laboratory for Chinese firms because of its great potential to transform from the world's poorest region into a major economic powerhouse.

In this study, the survey instrument was carefully prepared and developed. The questionnaire was initially constructed in English and then translated into Chinese with the help of two professional bilingual translators. Following the procedure recommended by Brislin (1986), we also back-translated the Chinese version into English with the assistance of two other independent bilingual translators to avoid comprehension issues and ensure conceptual equivalence (Xiao et al., 2020). To gain a better understanding of our focal concern and ensure construct validity, we carried out three in-depth field interviews with senior management officials—including CEOs, presidents, vice-presidents, or directors—in the MNE headquarters before administering the formal survey. The respondents were asked to check both the relevance and completeness of the questionnaire items and to ensure that these accurately reflect company management and practical industry contexts. On the basis of the feedback, we eliminated or modified several items and added new ones in the revised questionnaire. The survey was administered with an explanatory cover letter stating the objective of the study and the benefit to participants must assist our research. A high response rate was obtained as we guaranteed utter anonymity of participants and they may request for an executive summary of the results upon the completion of the study, if requested.

At the onset, we randomly selected 500 Chinese foreign-invested subsidiaries operating in Africa from sampling lists obtained with reference to the CnOpenData database and the Directory of Chinese MNEs' Overseas Subsidiaries published by China's Ministry of Commerce. These two databases include information on the overseas subsidiaries of major Chinese MNEs, such as their names and destinations of their FDIs. Given that this study focuses on RTK from overseas subsidiaries to their Chinese MNE headquarters, we only considered Chinese MNEs owning overseas subsidiaries in Africa that received equity-based investments. This decision was based on the idea that equity- and non-equity-based overseas investments may largely differ in terms of motivation, foreign expansion strategy, and subsequent resource commitment (Pan and Tse, 2000; Shimizu et al., 2004). Following the key informant approach recommended by Phillips (1981), we selected senior management officials, such as chief executives, presidents, vice-presidents, or directors, of MNEs as our key informants to collect valid and high-quality data. Given the potential challenges in administering our survey and the familiarity with the knowledge transfer behavior, we asked select senior managers to help us evaluate the knowledge transfer capabilities and behaviors of their overseas subsidiaries at both headquarter and subsidiary levels. The potential challenges in collecting high-quality data from Chinese firms have emphasized the importance of developing *guanxi* (i.e., good relationships and strong trust) in improving response rates and obtaining reliable and valid primary data (Peng and Luo, 2000). Therefore, several researchers from a renowned research company, have favorable relationships with Chinese firms, and were experienced in collecting primary data from the Chinese market were hired to help. Eventually, responses from 203 firms were obtained. Exclusion of five responses with missing data on one or more key variables yielded 198 usable questionnaires for the empirical analysis, resulting in an effective response rate of 39.6 %. In this sample, most (73.2 %) of MNEs had <500 employees and the majority (75 %) have been operating in Africa for <20 years. Their industries are as follows: 46.0 % of these firms were operating in construction, engineering, and infrastructure; 28.6 % were in manufacturing; and 25.1 % were in services (e.g., finance, leasing, and others).<sup>1</sup>

### 4.2. Bias testing

We checked for potential nonresponse bias, which is a concern for any survey-based research. Differences in the key characteristics (i.e., firm size and age) of the early- and late-responding firms were also checked. The t-statistics for the number of employees ( $t = 1.038, p > 0.17$ ) and age ( $t = 0.139, p > 0.23$ ) of the earliest- and latest-responding firms were all statistically insignificant, confirming that nonresponse bias is unlikely to be a concern in this study (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). In addition, given that the source of data were single respondents in each firm who answered self-report questionnaires, we checked for the presence of common method variance (CMV). However, such concern cannot be severe for this study as we followed several procedures that can reduce the influence of CMV on the results. First, the questionnaire was carefully designed to split the focal measures of major variables into several subsections to rule out a potential simple CMV-biased “straight line” response (Chang et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2011). Second, our questions are randomized by using a unique survey software and then the measures of several independent variables are reverse-coded to avoid a potentially CMV-biased pattern of responses. Third, through the cover letter, we informed the participants that they may remain anonymous and that their responses are to be treated with utmost confidentiality. Participants were also informed that the questions have no right or wrong answers and that their responses were only being used for research purposes. Nevertheless, the possible presence of CMV was examined by using Harman's one factor analysis (Podsakoff et al., 2003). A principal components factor analysis was carried out with the eigenvalue-greater-than-one criterion by including all multiple-item variables. The results of the unrotated factor analysis show that the first factor accounted for only 38.3 % of the total variance in the data, suggesting that no general factor was apparent and accounted for the majority of the variance. Therefore, CMV was unlikely to become a concern in this study.

### 4.3. Variables and measurement

Unless otherwise noted, the items of all dependent and independent variables were measured using multiple-item, seven-point Likert scales, where 1 indicates “strongly disagree” and 7 indicates “strongly agree.”

The dependent variable was RKT, defined as the knowledge flow from foreign subsidiaries to their MNE headquarters. The success of RKT was measured by using the seven-item scale developed by Najafi-Tavani et al. (2012). Respondents assessed the extent of success of transferring knowledge from their overseas subsidiaries to their MNE headquarters. Following prior studies (e.g., Oh and Anchor, 2017; Park, 2011), we defined the *knowledge development capability* of overseas subsidiaries as their ability to discover, assimilate, recreate, and transform knowledge into new information, thus allowing them to actively cultivate new values and support the pursuit of MNEs' strategic goals in local markets. Then, we asked the respondents to assess their foreign subsidiaries' capabilities to understand and use LMI to evaluate the *knowledge development capability* of overseas subsidiaries. This variable was measured by using multiple-item scales adopted from literature (Anh et al., 2006; Pak and Park, 2004; Park, 2011). Consistent with prior literature (we defined an overseas subsidiary's *possession of prior relevant knowledge* as the subsidiary's existing knowledge base and ownership of similar relevant knowledge (e.g., Ghauri and Park, 2012; Park, 2011). The *possession of prior relevant knowledge* of overseas subsidiaries was measured by using five items from literature (e.g., Anh et al., 2006). Specifically, respondents were asked to assess the similarities in the products, services, customers, basic technologies, and basic skills of their overseas subsidiaries and headquarters. In this study, *relational capital* refers to the degree and quality of relationships and interactions between headquarters and their subsidiaries (Oh et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2019). A four-item construct developed and validated in literature (e.g., Ghauri et al., 2013; Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Park, 2010) was used to measure the *relational capital* of overseas subsidiaries. The respondents were asked about their perceptions of the socialization mechanisms and the level of trust between their overseas subsidiaries and headquarters.

To rule out alternative explanations, we controlled for firm size, firm age, industry type, competitive intensity, and market growth into the analysis. Firm size was selected as a control variable because large firms may have more resources to devote to understanding the market information and knowledge and thus enjoy numerous advantages in learning knowledge (Autio et al., 2000; Simonin, 2004). Similarly, age may influence a firm's ability to identify and learn external knowledge in that older firms have more experience in international learning and knowledge acquisition than younger ones (Autio et al., 2000; Simonin, 2004). Following previous studies (e.g., Park and Xiao, 2021; Zhang et al., 2022), we measured the firm size as the logarithm of the total number of employees and firm age as the number of years since its establishment. Given that industrial environments and government policies in an industry may vary by sector (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998; Minbaeva et al., 2003), such industry-level factors may also influence the exchange of LMI. Thus, we also controlled for industry-level effect by creating a dummy variable that equals 1 if the firm's domain was in construction, engineering, and infrastructure. In addition, firms with rapid market growth and highly competitive pressures may perceive that learning valuable knowledge is crucial more than companies under staturated and less competitive environments. That is,

rapid market growth and competitive pressures may help firms realize the importance of issues, in this case RKT (Cui et al., 2005). In this regard, we controlled for the effects of market growth by asking the respondents to assess the average annual growth rate of their total sales in their focal market segment over the past three years using a 7-point Likert scale ( $1 = \text{"very low"}$ ,  $7 = \text{"very high"}$ ). We also controlled for the effect of competitive intensity by asking the respondents to assess the level of competition in their market environment using a 7-point Likert scale ( $1 = \text{"not competitive"}$ ,  $7 = \text{"extremely competitive"}$ ) adapted from previous work. The detailed information on the measurements is given in Table 1.

## 5. Empirical analyses and results

### 5.1. Construct reliability and validity

We empirically test our hypotheses using a PLS structural modeling approach (SEM) (Richter et al., 2016), which is an increasingly popular multivariate analysis method used in strategic management, marketing, and international business. This approach is particularly advantageous in handling various modeling problems by producing more accurate parameters than conventional covariance-based SEM techniques when the sample size ranges 100–250 (Hair et al., 2017). Before the empirical examination, we examined the reliability and validity of the constructs by estimating the measurement model.<sup>2</sup> Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics, factor loading, and the assessment of construct reliability and validity. The results show that both the Cronbach's alpha coefficients and composite reliabilities (CR) of our constructs were all higher than 0.80, clearly exceeding the 0.70 benchmark (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Nunnally, 1978). Thus, the measures of all individual constructs were proven reliable and valid. Table 1 also shows that the factor loading values of all constructs were both statistically significant and  $>0.70$ , thus further proving the model reliability and validity (Chin, 1998; Hulland, 1999). To assess the convergent validity of our measures, we also calculated the average variances extracted (AVE) for all our multi-item constructs. Table 1 also shows the results, where AVE values for all constructs were greater than the 0.50 benchmark and strongly supported the adequate convergent validity and reliability of our measures (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The discriminant validity of our measures was evaluated by comparing the square root of AVE of each construct with the absolute value of the correlation between each construct and all others in the model. Table 2 shows the results, which clearly show that the square root of AVE of each construct exceeded the absolute value of the correlation between each construct and all others, thereby confirming the adequate discriminant validity of our measures (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Furthermore, other procedures were adopted to test the discriminant validity of the factors in our model. Specifically, we compared the loading values of each indicator with the cross-loadings for other indicators. Given that each indicator loading exceeded its respective cross-loadings, the adequate discriminant validity of our measures was further confirmed. We also verified the discriminant validity by checking the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) of the correlations, which were all below 0.85, suggesting satisfactory discriminant validity (Hensler et al., 2015). Finally, following previous studies (e.g., Geisser, 1975; Stone, 1974), we examined the predictive validity of our constructs using Stone-Geisser's  $Q^2$ . The cross-validated communality and redundancy values were  $>0$ , again proving the predictive validity of our model (Fornell and Cha, 1994).

### 5.2. Hypothesis testing

Before testing our conceptual framework, we examined the possible presence of multicollinearity by checking the correlations among the variables and carrying out variance inflation factor (VIF) tests. Table 2 presents the results, which show no evidence that the inter-factor correlations exceeded the 0.70 benchmark (Anderson et al., 2016) and multicollinearity was unlikely to influence our data. All VIF values were below 2.6, which was far below the commonly accepted benchmark of 10 (Hair et al., 1998). Therefore, multicollinearity was an unlikely concern in our study (Burns and Bush, 2000).

Following the guidelines recommended by Chin (1998), we empirically tested the statistical significance of our path estimates by obtaining  $p$ -values via a bootstrap approach with 5000 samples. We examined the coefficients of determination  $R^2$ , which were equal to 0.214 and 0.535 for the endogenous variables of relational capital and RKT, respectively. These relatively high coefficients highlighted the satisfactory explanatory power of our structural model. Fig. 3 presents the results of SEM along with the path coefficients and their respective  $p$ -values. Knowledge development capability ( $b = 0.347$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ) and possession of prior relevant knowledge ( $b = 0.224$ ,  $p < 0.01$ ) had significantly positive relationships with relational capital. These results suggest that overseas subsidiaries with strong knowledge development capability and high prior relevant knowledge can develop more relational capital than other firms, strongly supporting Hypotheses 1 and 2.

We also examined the contributions of the abovementioned two variables to the success of RKT from overseas subsidiaries to MNE headquarters. Fig. 3 shows the results that the coefficient of knowledge development capability corresponding to RKT was positive and statistically significant ( $b = 0.330$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ), thus supporting Hypothesis 3. However, contrary to our expectations, the coefficient of possession of prior relevant knowledge was positive but not statistically significant, thereby rejecting Hypothesis 4. As such, overseas

<sup>2</sup> We also tested the robustness of our main results by performing validity tests using a covariance-based Amos modeling approach. The robustness check results indicated that the overall model generated by Amos showed adequate fit to the data ( $\chi^2(284) = 405.92$ ,  $p < 0.001$ , comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.96, incremental fit index [IFI] = 0.96, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.047). Moreover, the validity test results based on Amos were consistent with the main results based on PLS SEM. The details were omitted here due to space constraints but are available upon request from the authors.

subsidiaries with a strong knowledge development capability are more likely to achieve a successful RKT to their MNE parent headquarters, but their prior relevant knowledge does not play much role in guaranteeing such success.

statistically significant effect ( $b = 0.244$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ). Thus, overseas subsidiaries with high relational capital are more likely to achieve successful RKT to their MNE headquarters than other firms, supporting **Hypothesis 5**.

Following Zhao et al. (2010), we tested **Hypothesis 6** by empirically examining the potential mediating effects of relational capital on the relationships among knowledge development capability, possession of prior relevant knowledge, and RKT. Table 3 shows the results. The indirect effects ( $a \times b$ ) of knowledge development capability ( $b = 0.083$ ,  $p < 0.01$ ) and possession of prior relevant knowledge ( $b = 0.059$ ,  $p < 0.05$ ) were positive and statistically significant. In addition, knowledge development capability had positive and statistically significant direct effect on RKT (path  $c$ ) ( $b = 0.330$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ) and mediated effect ( $a \times b$ ) was positive and statistically significant. More importantly, both the direct and indirect effects ( $a \times b \times c$ ) of knowledge development capability were in the same direction, thus supporting the partial mediating role (complementary mediation) of relational capital in the relationship between knowledge development capability and RKT. However, possession of prior relevant knowledge had a positive but statistically insignificant direct effect on RKT (path  $c$ ) ( $b = 0.022$ ,  $p > 0.05$ ). Still, the mediated effect ( $a \times b$ ) of possession of prior relevant knowledge was positive and statistically significant. Therefore, these results suggested that relational capital had an indirect-only mediation effect on the relationship between possession of prior relevant knowledge and RKT, providing partial support for **Hypothesis 6**.

Finally, we tested the robustness of our findings by using different analytical approaches. Regression analyses and SEM estimation were carried out using a covariance-based Amos modeling approach. The results were effectively consistent to those obtained using PLS SEM, thus confirming the robustness of our main results. To also ensure the robustness of the mediated main results above, we carried out the three-step mediated regression approach recommended by Baron and Kenny (1986) by using Hayes's (2017) "PROCESS" macro procedure (10,000 resamples). The results show that each of the bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals for coefficients of the indirect effects excluded zero, providing consistent confirmation of the relational capital on the indirect effects of the independent variables (i.e., knowledge development capability and possession of prior relevant knowledge) on RKT through relational capital. Accordingly, the main results were generally robust to the use of either the three-step mediated regression or Hayes's (2017) approach. The robustness test results were not reported here due to space constraints but can be made available upon request.

### 5.3. Supplementary analysis<sup>3</sup>

Notably, to examine the importance of relational capital in moderating the relationships relating knowledge development capability and possession of prior relevant knowledge with RKT and to discuss their implications in detail were beyond the scope of this study. By further assessing the moderating role of relational capital, we attempted to offer a more comprehensive perspective on the complex relationships among knowledge transfer capability, relational capital, and RKT. To examine the moderating effect of relational capital, we carried out moderated regression analyses. Following Aiken and West (1991), we mean-centered all independent (i.e., knowledge development capability and possession of prior relevant knowledge) and moderating variables (i.e., relational capital) before estimating their interactive effects. The results demonstrated that knowledge development capability and relational capital was significant and negative interaction ( $b = -0.137$ ,  $p < 0.05$ ). Thus, as the social capital of overseas subsidiaries increases, the effect of knowledge development capability on RKT decreases. The interaction between possession of prior relevant knowledge and relational capital was, however, not significant ( $p = 0.743$ ). We further examined the moderating role of relational capital using a SEM technique and the results remained quantitatively unchanged.<sup>4</sup>

## 6. Discussion and conclusion

This study focuses on the RKT from overseas subsidiaries to headquarters and investigates whether and how this process within an MNE network is associated with the former's knowledge transfer capability and its relationship with the latter. An empirical analysis is carried out using survey data collected from a sample of Chinese MNEs with overseas subsidiaries operating in Africa. Contrary to the general belief that MNE headquarters transfer their knowledge to their subsidiaries in this 'blue ocean' market, we find that a considerable amount of such knowledge flows from the latter to the former. This finding suggests that knowledge transfer is a two-way traffic even in unknown markets. In addition, compared with other firms, overseas subsidiaries with an excellent knowledge development capability and high prior relevant knowledge can better establish strong relationships with their headquarters, thereby guaranteeing their success of knowledge transfer.

Contrary to **Hypothesis 4**, the coefficient of possession of prior relevant knowledge was positive yet not statistically significant (Table 2), suggesting that this factor is relevant but far from being a catalyst for overseas subsidiaries to successfully engage in RKT. The possible reason is that the types of knowledge obtained by head offices from their foreign subsidiaries vary according to the economic level of the region (Driffield et al., 2016). Africa is relatively less economically developed than other countries, and as a result, the knowledge gained locally is unlikely sophisticated but rather highly bounded and information intensive. Given that African LMI is considered as the target of RKT, having prior relevant knowledge is necessary for a successful RKT to a certain extent but may not be required when delivering modern information (e.g., technology).

As an alternative interpretation, if we experimented with the explicit knowledge (e.g., technology) of reverse transference, then

<sup>3</sup> As said in the text, the supplementary moderation approach is beyond of our research objective. This is the reason why we do not provide moderation hypotheses nor a moderated-mediation hypotheses.

having prior relevant knowledge may become a crucial determinant of the success of RKT by facilitating the sharing of cognitive structures between knowledge transferors and acquirers. Specifically, this factor allows the knowledge transferors to effectively teach, instruct, and ultimately incorporate its own new data to enhance the effect for knowledge acquirers, given that the possession of familiar relevant information often facilitates codifiable learning. Park (2011) contends that having inadequate prior relevant knowledge of their headquarters considerably inhibit the knowledge flow of subsidiaries by introducing difficulties in the application of previous successful experiences. However, the present study focuses on LMI, which is a type of culturally cultivated information that is difficult to codify. Therefore, the positive effect of prior relevant knowledge may be weak in the present study context, explaining its positive yet statistically insignificant coefficient. Future studies can further explore this conjecture.

### 6.1. Theoretical contributions

This study offers several important contributions. First, this study contributes to the literature on knowledge management by demonstrating that the knowledge transfer capability and relational capital of overseas subsidiaries are critical factors for the success of RKT. Although recent studies have shown that knowledge can flow not only from the head office to overseas subsidiaries but also vice versa (Buckley et al., 2014; Reilly et al., 2023), theoretical explorations of such RKT remain few. As a result, a systematic understanding of those factors that influence RKT success/failure and when and/or under what circumstances it takes place remains lacking. The present findings demonstrate that LMI is transferred most successfully when overseas subsidiaries retain their firm-specific capabilities in developing local market knowledge and have a strong relationship with their head offices. Moreover, overseas subsidiaries with strong knowledge development capabilities and high prior relevant knowledge can develop high relational capital for their MNE headquarters. Interestingly, knowledge development capability not only directly affects the success of RKT but also exerts an indirect effect through relational capital, which is another important factor in this process. Therefore, by providing a theoretical insight into how overseas subsidiary's knowledge transfer capacity and relational capital positively influence the generation of RKT, this study shows that the knowledge transfer within an MNE network does not only depend on the knowledge acquirer's (i.e., learning firm) absorptive capacity but also hinge on the knowledge transferor's (i.e., teaching firm) teaching capability. The findings also shed light on the importance of favorable learning environments built upon high relational capital.

Second, this study highlights the crucial role of overseas subsidiaries in emerging unknown markets in facilitating knowledge transfer within MNE networks. In such markets, the significance of overseas subsidiaries has been primarily explored in terms of cost advantage and resource availability (Adomako et al., 2019). Accordingly, such overseas subsidiaries need to successfully acquire firm-specific knowledge from their head office to build their competitive advantage in the local market (Nair et al., 2018). Although the importance of overseas subsidiaries is recognized as a critical source of knowledge transfer within an MNE network, this is generally the case where the head office in an EM enters developed countries and seeks to acquire cutting-edge knowledge and information (e.g., Athreya et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2018). Consequently, few scholars investigate overseas subsidiaries in unknown EMs (e.g., Africa) as potential channels for knowledge transfer within an MNE network. Therefore, the present study explores how overseas subsidiaries play a significant role in such knowledge transfer especially when a head office in a relatively developed EM (e.g., China) enters another developing EM. We expand the research on the factors of knowledge transfer in MNE networks by demonstrating that “knowledge transfer capacity” and “relational capital of subsidiaries with headquarters in EMs” positively influence the generation of RKT.

Third, capability-based factors may differ from one place to another, given that prior relevant knowledge of overseas subsidiaries is not significantly associated with the success of RKT. The types of knowledge obtained by head offices from foreign subsidiaries vary according to the economic level of the region (Driffield et al., 2016). A foreign subsidiary operating in an economically developed local market is more likely to transfer information-intensive and high-dimensional knowledge (e.g., scientific knowledge or technology) to its headquarters. If so, then the knowledge transfer becomes more effective when both parties are aware of the relevant information (Joia and Lemos, 2010). However, in the African market context, the subsidiaries' possession of prior relevant knowledge is not important in their delivery of information to MNE headquarters. Given that Africa has a relatively low economic development compared with other regions, the knowledge obtained is unlikely to be sophisticated or scientific but rather culturally embedded. Given the varying type of knowledge transferred from overseas subsidiaries based on the region, the critical factors for an effective RKT may also change. In other words, instead of following the patterns of MNEs, the capability-based factors for a successful RKT may differ from one place to another.

### 6.2. Practical and policy implications

First, the findings offer practical implications for MNE managers by suggesting that LMI can be effectively transferred to headquarters when they have sufficient stock of relational capital with their subsidiaries. MNE managers typically consider how to overcome a “liability of foreignness” by effectively adapting to uncertain foreign markets and policies. In addition, unknown blue ocean markets such as Africa have been described as a “double-edged sword” that can either offer a great opportunity or lead to an enormous failure (Nachum et al., 2022). As such, the “liability of foreignness” in Africa is much greater than in any other region and MNE headquarters have enough incentives to effectively acquire, accumulate, and utilize information that can only be obtained in this host country to quickly respond to the local market and formulate the appropriate strategies (Zaheer, 1995). RKT is particularly effective when overseas subsidiaries have strong relationship with their head offices. Therefore, MNEs should regard overseas subsidiaries as important channels for valuable LMI and establish and maintain fundamental relationships with them to reduce their liability of foreignness.

Second, as a policy implication, we strongly emphasize the importance of the knowledge transfer capabilities of overseas subsidiaries to the success of an RKT within an MNE network. In the perspective of subsidiaries, selectively acquiring necessary information from a vast amount of local knowledge and effectively delivering value to the head office both require sufficient long-term investment. To this end, headquarters should provide continuous and sufficient support, but most companies (i.e., subsidiaries) lack such financial and managerial leeway (or freedom). In other words, most companies face difficulties in securing enough initial investments for an effective RKT from overseas subsidiaries. Therefore, government-level support and various policies are needed for MNEs to effectively obtain valuable LMI from their overseas subsidiaries. Examples are government support for the initial cost of overseas market research and provision of local networks or experts to small-sized overseas subsidiaries.

Third, for MNEs, absorption of local knowledge has perhaps been the primary motivation of subsidiary establishment, and thus they commonly hope to receive various LMI from their overseas subsidiaries. Knowledge transfer from subsidiaries mainly focus on strengthening four areas of MNEs, as follows: (1) adequate understanding on local institutional voids (e.g., norms, rules, and regulations); (2) understanding of local culture including customer characteristics; (3) determining means for MNE promotion and commercialization and (4) acquiring technology (in the case where MNEs set up subsidiaries in developed economies). The absorption of such knowledge assists MNEs to implement knowledge and technological innovations to improve their competitiveness and promote firm growth (emphasis added). Governments should enable beneficiaries (MNEs) to properly deal with knowledge problems (i.e., absence of necessary local information) by creating policies and strengthening their support. Thus, MNEs can reduce mistakes and errors in local markets, meet local institutional standards, have a good grasp of consumers' tastes, minimize cost, and enhance other operations-related activities.

### 6.3. Limitations and future research

This study has several limitations that provide opportunities for future research. First, we only use a sample of Chinese companies. Given that the relationship between headquarters and overseas subsidiaries may differ due to cultural factors, RKT may exhibit diverse flow patterns across cultures. Second, we tested our hypotheses using questionnaire data. Although we controlled for various methodological problems that may arise in the survey, a more rigorous analysis may have been possible if actual manager interviews and secondary data were used together (i.e., data triangulation). Third, we carried out our analyses without considering industry differences and firm size.

Future studies may investigate whether our hypotheses also hold among MNEs in countries that are culturally different from China (e.g., North America and Western Europe). Comparative cultural studies can further refine our theory by establishing its boundary conditions. Our understanding of the factors behind a successful RKT may also be refined through simultaneous interviews with managers and surveys. Furthermore, RKT can be checked if it follows different patterns across various industries and firm sizes. Given that the characteristics and types of information differ across industries and the relationship between headquarters and their subsidiaries may vary depending on firm size, future studies may test the generalizability of our findings based on these factors. Future research can also explore the role of possession of prior relevant knowledge in several domains, such as tacit versus explicit knowledge. Finally, we acknowledge that mixed-method approach can be a pragmatic approach to combine two complementary views. That is, designing two questionnaires to collect responses from headquarter representatives and subsidiary representatives, respectively, within the same MNEs (Su et al., 2022) may strengthen the robustness of the results.

### 6.4. Conclusion

Using data from Chinese subsidiaries that have entered the African market, this study provides a theoretical explanation for effective knowledge transfer from overseas subsidiaries to headquarters in certain contexts. A high knowledge transfer capacity exerts a positive effect on the success of RKT by enhancing the relationship between headquarters and their subsidiaries. Moreover, the knowledge development capability of subsidiaries directly and indirectly (through relational capital) affects the success of RKT. However, contrary to our expectations, prior relevant knowledge of subsidiaries is not as significant to RKT, suggesting that the types of knowledge transferred to headquarters may vary depending on the region. If so, then the essential elements for a successful RKT may also vary across contexts. Therefore, the boundary condition of our theory needs further elaboration in future studies by considering cultural differences and regional characteristics.
