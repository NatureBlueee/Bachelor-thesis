## Abstract

**Purpose** – Reverse mentoring and job crafting are innovative, employee-driven job resources that can lead to positive organizational outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of work engagement in mediating the association of these resources with work performance and work withdrawal behavior.

**Design/methodology/approach** – Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling on data obtained from 369 software developers in India.

**Findings** – Findings demonstrate that reverse mentoring and job crafting are positively related to work engagement, which, in turn, increase performance and decreases work withdrawal behaviors. Work engagement partially mediates the association of job crafting with both outcomes. In contrast, work engagement fully mediates the relationship between reverse mentoring and withdrawal behavior and partially mediates the relationship between reverse mentoring and work performance.

**Research limitations/implications** – This study is a cross-sectional, survey design in the understudied technical industry in India, which may limit generalizability. However, the authors also connect the previously unrelated literatures on reverse mentoring and work engagement and develop a scale for use in future reverse mentoring studies.

**Practical implications** – This study provides evidence to support practitioners in implementing resources for reverse mentoring and job crafting to increase work engagement among employees and subsequent positive outcomes.

**Originality/value** – Organizations can support reverse mentoring and job crafting as cost effective employee development tools. The research focuses on the mentors, who tend to be the less experienced and younger counterparts in a reverse mentoring pair and a critical part of the workforce for the growing IT industry.

**Keywords** Job crafting, Reverse mentoring, Work engagement, Performance, India

## Introduction

Engagement at work has been consistently shown to improve important employee outcomes, including performance, commitment, health and retention (Halbesleben, 2010). Work engagement is conceptualized as a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by vigor, dedication and absorption (Schaufeli *et al.*, 2002). In a growing economy and tightening labor market worldwide (Schwab, 2017), it is advantageous for organizations to focus on creating an engaging environment while managing costs. This study investigates reverse mentoring and job crafting as two job resources, which may foster work engagement and subsequently improve performance and reduce withdrawal behaviors.

Reverse mentoring, a bottom-up approach to mentoring, is an innovative tool (Murphy, 2012) to improve employees' engagement in the organization. In a reverse mentoring relationship, the junior person serves as mentor and the senior person as mentee, which is particularly helpful for engaging younger workers who express a desire for early recognition (Glass, 2007) as well as more exposure to senior colleagues and career support

(Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Murphy, 2012). Previous work has theorized that reverse mentoring is associated with work engagement (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012); however, no studies to our knowledge have developed a scale or tested this association.

Through self-initiated optimization of job demands and resources, job crafting helps employees to align their work environment with their needs and abilities (Tims and Bakker, 2010) and to achieve work autonomy and work meaningfulness fostering engagement. Studies have reported that job crafting predicts engagement (e.g. Petrou *et al.*, 2012; Tims *et al.*, 2013; Tims *et al.*, 2015), though they were conducted in a European context, limiting generalizability.

This study extends the extant literature in multiple ways. First, building on prior studies by Hu *et al.* (2013) and Birtch *et al.* (2016), we integrate social exchange theory (SET) with the job demands-resources model (JD-R) to explain the mechanism underlying an individual's response to job resources. Second, we develop a scale to measure reverse mentoring. Finally, we examine the role of work engagement in mediating the relationships between reverse mentoring and job crafting with work outcomes (work performance and work withdrawal behaviors).

## Theoretical framework

The JD-R model suggests that employees evaluate job stressors (i.e. role ambiguity and insecurity) as potentially challenging and/or threatening. Challenge stressors (time pressure and job crafting) are demands that are appraised as having the potential to promote work engagement and personal development (Cavanaugh *et al.*, 2000). While hindrance demands (role ambiguity and job insecurity) lead to burnout (Podsakoff *et al.*, 2007) because these factors erode energy and exhaust mental and physical resources through sustained effort over time (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007). Thus, the JD-R model explains psychological conditions or antecedents for work engagement, yet it does not address the mechanism underlying individuals' response to these factors with different engagement levels (Saks, 2006). However, SET helps explain this mechanism. A social exchange view of employment posits that when employees receive job resources (e.g. support/autonomy) they feel obliged to return the same to the organization in the form of increased engagement levels. Consequently, we combine the JD-R model to explain the structural framework of relationships between job resources, engagement and organizational outcomes with SET to explain the mechanism behind individual's response to the job resources in the terms of increased engagement levels.

### Work engagement

In relation to the JD-R model, Schaufeli *et al.* (2002) defined engagement as an active and absolute work associated mind state represented by vigor, dedication and absorption. Vigor is marked by high levels of energy and resilience at work depicting readiness to devote efforts in achieving work goals and endurance to face work demands; dedication refers to attaching a strong sense of pride, enthusiasm and significance toward one's work and absorption implies a happy and positive state of complete engrossment in the work, wherein one loses complete track of time and finds it difficult to detach from work. Several studies have validated this model (e.g. Schaufeli and Bakker, 2003; Xanthopoulos *et al.*, 2007).

The JD-R literature (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007; Van De Voorde *et al.*, 2016) establishes job resources as an important antecedent of work engagement and provides evidence that a motivational process is triggered by job resources which leads to work engagement. Job resources refer to “those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that may (1) be functional in achieving work goals, (2) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs, and (3) stimulate personal growth, learning, and

development” (Demerouti *et al.*, 2001, p. 501). Therefore, any resource offered by the organization which assists employees in goal performance, learning and development and/or coping with job demands will be deemed a job resource.

Recent research highlights that employee-driven approaches can act as sustainable sources of work engagement leading to significant organizational outcomes (Dubbelt *et al.*, 2019; Rivera and Flinck, 2011). Employee-driven job resources may be located at the task level, job/role level or the interpersonal or relational level to have motivating potential (Demerouti and Bakker, 2011). We argue that when an organization facilitates reverse mentoring (relational level) and job crafting (task and/or role level), employees also perceive these job resources as strong organizational supports and feel indebted toward the organization. According to SET, employees are guided by exchange and reciprocity norms and hence return the favor to the organization in the form of increased engagement levels (Saks, 2006).

### Reverse mentoring and job crafting at work

### Antecedents of work engagement

#### Reverse mentoring

Reverse mentoring refers to an approach wherein a younger, junior employee mentors an older or hierarchically senior executive to share technological expertise, subject matter advances and/or provide a different perspective (Murphy, 2012). The academic literature on reverse mentoring is mostly conceptual and at a latent stage (Kaše *et al.*, 2019). Prior research built a theoretical foundation by identifying the key characteristics, antecedents and outcomes of reverse mentoring (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Murphy, 2012) as well as assessing its functions in contrast with traditional mentoring (Chen, 2013; Murphy, 2012). The key aspects of reverse mentoring that differentiate it from traditional mentoring relationships are: (1) structural role reversal wherein junior acts as mentor and senior acts a mentee; (2) two-way knowledge sharing; (3) emphasis on mentor's leadership and competency development and (4) commitment toward mutual learning and support (Murphy, 2012). This means that the support functions are slightly different, with knowledge exchange and skill development replacing sponsorship and protection, which are only possible due to one's role in the organizational hierarchy.

Reverse mentoring as a practice has developed from the single focus of technological knowledge sharing to a tool for (1) harnessing intergenerational competencies (at Microsoft India), (2) breaking hierarchical work structures (at PwC India), (3) building leadership pipeline and revamping performance management processes through flexibility benefits (at Lenskart) and (4) re-orientation of recruitment and HR strategies (at Marico, Airtel and Accenture) as reported by Mannal (2017). Procter and Gamble has successfully implemented reverse mentoring to decrease attrition among female managers and for gender sensitization (Zielinski, 2000); General Motors has also used it to increase productivity and enhance online collaboration (Harvey *et al.*, 2009). This study begins to elucidate the increasing prevalence of reverse mentoring in industry, while broadening the scope of the academic literature.

In congruence with the JD-R model, we argue that reverse mentoring, as an interpersonal job resource, positively affects work engagement. Given the benefits of reverse mentoring, its availability is perceived as an organizational support by participants, which in turn makes them feel valued. Guided by the reciprocity norms of SET, participants will thus feel obliged to reciprocate and return the favor in the form of increased engagement levels (Saks, 2006). As such, Chaudhuri and Ghosh (2012) proposed reverse mentoring is a tool for engaging boomers and increasing commitment of Millennials. Similarly, practitioners offer support for this association. “*The biggest outcome of reverse mentoring is that we have a very engaged workforce across levels*” – says Anurita Chopra, area marketing lead, GSK Consumer Healthcare (Basu and Verma, 2017).

### Job crafting

With reference to the JD-R framework, job crafting is described as an organizational intervention (Van Wingerden *et al.*, 2017), wherein an employee gets to modify the available demands and/or resources of their job (Tims and Bakker, 2010) to increase the fit between work and self. This fit can be achieved through four kinds of behaviors: (1) increasing structural job resources (such as autonomy); (2) increasing social resources (such as social support); (3) increasing challenging job demands and/or (4) decreasing hindering job demands. Since the fourth behavior (decreasing hindering job demands) has been found to be unrelated to work engagement (Tims *et al.*, 2012; Tims *et al.*, 2013), this study focuses on the first three behaviors.

Job crafting is posited to be an effective bottom-up strategy to boost work engagement, as it helps employees improve their person-organization fit. Fit is enhanced by creating interventions in the form of modified job resources and job demands which enable employees to create a resourceful and individually optimized work environment, thereby, leading to enhanced work engagement (Tims *et al.*, 2015). Moreover, when employees receive such autonomy to craft their jobs, their performance (Bakker *et al.*, 2012; Tims *et al.*, 2012) and wellbeing (Nielsen and Abildgaard, 2012) is also enhanced. Job crafting thus meets the criteria of a job resource enabling employees to proactively modify their work environment to efficiently achieve their work goals and stimulate their personal growth and development.

Since, the organization creates the work context, wherein employees are given the autonomy to facilitate bottom up approaches like job crafting (Bakker, 2017); based on social exchange theory, we argue that employees will perceive job crafting opportunities as valued organizational support, to which they will reciprocate with increased levels of engagement. Past studies also reveal that the magnitude of job crafting behavior carried on by an employee is a predictor of his/her work engagement level (Bakker *et al.*, 2012; Petrou *et al.*, 2012; Tims *et al.*, 2015). Thus, we propose:

H1. (a) Reverse mentoring and (b) job crafting will be positively associated with work engagement.

### Consequences of work engagement

#### Work performance

Performance is an essential outcome of job-related behavior. Engaged employees deliver better performance compared to non-engaged employees (Bakker, 2009) because they (1) experience more positive emotions (Schaufeli and Van Rhenen, 2006), (2) have better health leading to full utilization of available resources, (3) create their own job and personal resources leading to efficient handling of job demands and achievement of work goals (Bakker *et al.*, 2007) and (4) indulge in engagement transfer to others in their work environment (Bakker and Xanthopoulou, 2009). Several studies confirm the positive relationship between engagement and job performance (Yalabik *et al.*, 2013; Mäkikangas *et al.*, 2016).

#### Work withdrawal behaviors

Work withdrawal behaviors are unfavorable behaviors displayed by unsatisfied employees, wherein they tend to avoid work or minimize time devoted to work without jeopardizing organizational membership or their work-role. It is an attempt to psychologically and physically disengage from work by neglecting tasks, leaving work early or taking long breaks for example (Lehman and Simpson, 1992). Withdrawal behaviors not only lead to poor performance and disruptive organizational functioning (Hansich and Hulin, 1990) but are also considered worse than actual turnover (Kammeyer-Mueller and Wanberg, 2003). Scholars argue that keeping withdrawal behaviors in check is important because mild behaviors

(e.g. lateness) can intensify into serious organizational issues (e.g. turnover) (Koslowsky *et al.*, 1997) and result in high costs both to the organization and to the individuals enacting them. Engaged employees do not avoid or neglect work, rather they have a positive and proactive attitude toward work (Zeijen *et al.*, 2018) and exhibit more innovative behavior (Duff, 2017). Thus, we hypothesize that:

Reverse mentoring and job crafting at work

H2. Work engagement will be (a) positively related to work performance and (b) negatively related to work withdrawal behaviors.

### Work engagement as a mediator

Past studies have found substantial evidence for the role of work engagement in mediating the association between antecedents and work consequences (Bailey *et al.*, 2017; Saks, 2006). Based on the JD-R model, we similarly expect that job resources, in this study reverse mentoring and job crafting, as antecedents predict work engagement which leads to work outcomes (work performance and work withdrawal behaviors) (e.g. Agarwal and Gupta, 2018; Bakker *et al.*, 2012; Tims *et al.*, 2012). Social exchange theory further explains the underlying mechanism involved in these relationships. When employees receive positive benefits in the form of job resource opportunities from the organization, they develop a feeling of obligation toward the organization which they repay in the form of increased work engagement and enhanced work outcomes like performance (Cronpanzano and Mitchell, 2005; Saks, 2006).

Job resources are significantly associated with work goals (Bakker and Albrecht, 2018). Past research demonstrates the positive association between job crafting and self-reported performance through work engagement as a mediator (Tims *et al.*, 2013, 2015). Theoretically, when employees are given the opportunity to craft their job and improve person-job fit, it enables them to achieve efficient and enhanced performance and to make their work more interesting and rewarding (Tims *et al.*, 2015), which tends to simultaneously reduce their work withdrawal symptoms. In parallel, the positive impact of traditional mentoring on employee performance has been demonstrated across many studies (Allen *et al.*, 2009; Srivastava and Thakur, 2013). Similarly, Walumbwa and Lawler (2003) found that transformational leaders used mentoring to reduce work withdrawal behaviors among their employees. Thus, we expect that reverse mentoring will improve performance and reduce work withdrawal behaviors through work engagement. Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:

H3. Work engagement will mediate the association between (a) reverse mentoring and work performance, (b) reverse mentoring and work withdrawal behaviors, (c) job crafting and work performance and (d) job crafting and work withdrawal behaviors.

The proposed conceptual model is illustrated in Figure 1.

We investigate these relationships in the fast-growing Indian IT sector, a context that has received limited attention in the academic literature on work engagement thus far (Gupta, 2018). The IT industry faces disengagement issues due to work uncertainty and volatility embedded in the nature of the job (Sekhar *et al.*, 2018). This not only prevents employees from actively engaging in work but also hampers their productivity and gives rise to withdrawal symptoms (Manjunath and Chandni, 2018). Therefore, finding HR strategies that facilitate work engagement has practical significance and potential application across a variety of industries and contexts.

## Method

### *Participants and procedure*

The survey was administered online. Participation was voluntary, and participants were informed that their responses would remain confidential. We worked with 14 software firms

![Figure 1: Proposed conceptual model. The model shows several variables and their relationships. Key variables include Work Engagement, Work Performance, Work Withdrawal Behavior, Psychological Withdrawal Behavior, Physical Withdrawal Behavior, Job Crafting, Reverse Mentoring, Challenging Job Demands, Structural Job Resources, Social Job Resources, Vigor, Dedication, and Absorption. Solid lines indicate positive associations (e.g., Vigor, Dedication, Absorption positively influence Work Engagement, which positively influences Work Performance). Dashed lines indicate negative associations (e.g., Challenging Job Demands, Structural Job Resources, Social Job Resources negatively influence Work Engagement, which negatively influences Work Performance).](73c3e4508cae529acf4e6c7fa70b361a_img.jpg)

**Note(s):** --- Antecedents' association with work outcome

to identify junior employees with a minimum of one-year work experience as software developers, who in some way mentored their senior colleagues, in other words, were in a reverse mentoring relationship. The team leaders in the selected software firms were contacted and requested to identify those employees who were involved in frequent (formal/informal) bottom-up knowledge transfer (not limited to just a technological issue) to the seniors. These employees were then requested to respond to the survey. Of the 480 possible respondents, 369 completed the survey which included 73.7% men and 26.3% women, consistent with industry composition. The majority of respondents were 25–34 years-old, single/unmarried, with 2–5 years' work experience (see Table 1). Since this is one of the few studies to empirically test the association of reverse mentoring with work engagement and other outcome variables hence to keep the model parsimonious, this study did not treat the demographics as control variables.

### *Measures*

*Reverse mentoring* was assessed using an 11-item scale developed for this study. Based on the extant literature, we created items to capture the characteristics and functions of reverse mentoring (Chen, 2013; Murphy, 2012). Following a deductive approach, extensive literature review was done to establish a clear link between the scale items and the theoretical domain of the construct. Items were generated from the reverse mentoring literature (Chen, 2013; Murphy, 2012), including a few items adapted from practice (Basu and Verma, 2017; Mannel, 2017), from a traditional mentoring scale (Castro et al., 2005) and from an existing untested scale on reverse mentoring (Chen, 2014).

Content validity was assessed by having items carefully reviewed by external established mentoring scholars to check ambiguity and interpretation of each statement. The items were validated as representative of the reverse mentoring construct. Following best practices (Hinkin, 1995; Wright et al., 2017), adequate precautions were taken to (1) avoiding usage of reverse-coded items; (2) generating items such that parsimony is maintained without compromising reliability and construct validity; (3) scaling of items to allow sufficient variance among responses and (4) sample population and sample size.

The scale was pre-tested on a sample of 135 post-graduate management students who had a minimum of one year work experience in the Indian IT sector and were involved in reverse mentoring exchanges. Exploratory analysis indicated a single factor explained 55.19% variance, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.91. The study sample confirmed that all the items loaded on a single factor with Cronbach's alpha of 0.92 (Nunnally, 1978). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity of the construct (see Table 2). Standardized factor loadings

**Table 2.**  
Scale reliability and validity of the constructs

(Appendix) were all greater than 0.50, fit indices (GFI, NFI and CFI) were all  $>0.09$  and RMSEA was  $<0.08$ . The average variance extracted (AVE) was 0.51, indicating satisfactory convergent validity of the scale (Hair *et al.*, 2013). The square root of AVE was greater than the observed correlations of the variable (reverse mentoring) with other variables in the model, thereby ensuring the discriminant validity of the scale (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).

The reverse mentoring scale (Appendix) starts with the following stem: "Think of a situation when you have trained/taught your senior (mentee) about a new technology or transferred knowledge (KT). As a mentor, answer the following". Sample items on the scale include "I feel empowered updating my mentee (senior) on the latest technologies and emerging trends" and "We both treat each other as friends". Responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from *strongly disagree* (1) to *strongly agree* (5).

*Job crafting* was assessed using the three-dimensional job crafting scale developed by Tims *et al.* (2012). Sample items for (1) increasing social job resources, include "I ask my supervisor to coach me" and "I ask others for feedback on my job performance"; (2) increasing challenging job demands, include "When an interesting project comes along, I offer myself proactively as project coworker" and "I regularly take on extra tasks even though I do not receive extra salary for them" and (3) increasing structural job resources, include "I try to develop my capabilities" and "I try to learn new things at work". Responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from *never* (1) to *very often* (5).

*Work engagement* was measured with the three-dimensional, nine-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) by Schaufeli *et al.* (2006). Sample items for (1) vigor, include "At my work, I feel bursting with energy" and "At my job, I feel strong and vigorous"; (2) dedication, include "I am enthusiastic about my job" and "My job inspires me" and (3) absorption, include "I am immersed in my work" and "I get carried away when I am working". The response was scored on a seven-point Likert scale from *never* (0) to *every day* (7).

*Work performance* was assessed using the seven-item scale constructed by Abramis (1985) to determine the performance of employees during the last six months. Sample items include "How well you were making decisions", and "How well you were meeting deadlines". Items were scored on a five-point Likert scale ranging from *very poor* (1) to *very well* (5). As reported by Kock (2017), self-reported assessment of performance not only reflects good validity and reliability but also found to be a better measure over objective measures such as ratings given by supervisors. Furthermore, prior studies (e.g.: Singh *et al.*, 2012; Suar and Khuntia, 2010) provide wide support for Abramis' (1985) self-reported measure of performance and validate it amongst the studied sample of Indian software developers (see Singh *et al.*, 2012).

*Work withdrawal behaviors* were assessed using the 12-item scale developed by Lehman and Simpson (1992). It includes two dimensions of psychological withdrawal behaviors and physical withdrawal behaviors during the last six months. Sample items on (1) psychological withdrawal behaviors, include "How often have you thought of being absent" and "How often have you left your work station for unnecessary reasons" and (2) physical withdrawal behaviors, include "How often have you taken a longer lunch or rest break than allowed" and "How often have you fallen asleep at work". Items were recorded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from *almost never* (1) to *very often* (5).

Considering the recommendations of Podsakoff *et al.* (2003), both procedural and statistical remedies were followed to control common method bias. Accordingly, Harman's single-factor test (Harman, 1976) revealed a variance of 23.67%, thereby implying that the data did not suffer from common method bias.

### Data analysis

A multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on Amos 22.0 (Arbuckle, 2016) to assess the fit of our measurement model (Byrne, 2001; Fu *et al.*, 2020). The analysis indicate

that the five-factor model (proposed) fits reasonably well to the data with the RMSEA, relative chi-square and the CFI satisfying their criteria of  $<0.07$  (MacCallum *et al.*, 1996),  $<3$  (Kline, 1998) and  $>0.90$  (Awang, 2015), respectively, and NFI and GFI were  $>0.80$  (Forza and Filippini, 1998). In addition, it performed better than the default model in which all the items and nine-factor structure (i.e. reverse mentoring, challenging job demands, structural job resources, vigor, dedication, absorption, work performance, psychological withdrawal and physical withdrawal behavior) were analyzed in their entirety as well as the one-factor model (see Table 2).

In addition, following the work of Biswar and Suar (2016) and Singh *et al.* (2012), construct reliability and convergent validity were further assessed by conducting CFA for each variable as reported in Table 2. GFI, CFI and NFI scores were all greater than 0.90, indicating that all items to each construct had a good fit; RMSEA was equal to or less than 0.08 except for job crafting whose RMSEA was 0.09 (MacCallum *et al.*, 1996). The Cronbach's alpha for all constructs was greater than 0.70 (Nunnally, 1978), indicating that the items used to measure each construct had good internal consistency. Items with factor loadings  $<0.40$  were dropped as recommended by Stevens (1992). None of the items in the increasing social job resources dimension of job crafting had loading range  $>0.40$ ; hence, this dimension was not included in the results reported. Convergent validity was further validated by analyzing the composite reliability (CR) of all factors. As composite reliability of all constructs ranged from 0.84 to 0.92, which surpassed the acceptable level of 0.60 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981), convergent validity was ensured in this study. Evidence for discriminant validity is provided when measures of constructs that theoretically should not be highly related to each other are, in fact, unrelated. Discriminant validity in this study was established by ensuring that there are no correlations above 0.85 between the constructs (Kline and Schermelleh-Engel, 2010; Weston and Gore, 2006). A weak correlation between the two constructs provides evidence of discriminant difference between them (Swank and Mullen, 2017), thereby, implying them to be conceptually different constructs.

## Results

Table 4 shows the correlation matrix for all variables in the study, which were all in the hypothesized direction.

We used latent variable structural equation modeling (LVSEM), on Amos 22.0 (Arbuckle, 2016), as shown in Figure 2. LVSEM reveals antecedent-consequence associations among the studied variables to investigate the unreserved proposition in correlations which are bidirectional (MacKenzie, 2001) by defining separately both the measurement model and the structural model. Moreover, it controls measurement errors both random and systematic (Podsakoff *et al.*, 2003).

Path coefficients were consistent with the direct correlations between the dimensions of work engagement, observed previously, highlighting consistency in conceptualization. Following Schaufeli *et al.'s* (2006) marker for high work engagement (vigor  $\ge 4.81$ , absorption  $\ge 4.71$ , dedication  $\ge 4.21$ ), about 57 % of participants reported high work engagement.

Standardized path coefficients reflected that reverse mentoring ( $\beta = 0.40$ ,  $p < 0.01$ ) and job crafting ( $\beta = 0.39$ ,  $p < 0.01$ ) were each positively associated with work engagement (see Figure 3), supporting Hypothesis 1. Work engagement was positively associated with work performance ( $\beta = 0.12$ ,  $p < 0.10$ ) and negatively associated with work withdrawal behaviors ( $\beta = -0.31$ ,  $p < 0.01$ ), supporting Hypothesis 2. Following conditions of mediation specified by Baron and Kenny (1986) and Holmbeck (1997, p. 602), the independent variables of reverse mentoring and job crafting were first directly associated with the mediator of work engagement, showing that both variables significantly increased work engagement. Second, work engagement was significantly positively associated with performance and negatively associated with withdrawal behaviors. Finally, after controlling the effects of work

engagement, the original associations (see Figure 2) of reverse mentoring ( $\beta = 0.29, p < 0.01$ ) and job crafting ( $\beta = 0.70, p < 0.01$ ) in increasing work performance were significantly reduced ( $\beta = 0.24$  and  $\beta = 0.36$ , respectively,  $p < 0.01$ ; see Figure 3), suggesting partial mediation. In addition, the relationship between job crafting and withdrawal behaviors was significantly reduced (from  $\beta = -0.44, p < 0.01$  to  $\beta = -0.18, p < 0.05$ ), while the relationship between reverse mentoring and work withdrawal behaviors reduced but was no longer significant (from  $\beta = -0.17, p < 0.05$  to  $\beta = -0.05, p < 0.05$ ), demonstrating that work engagement fully mediates the relationship between reverse mentoring and work withdrawal behaviors (see Figures 2 and 3), thus Hypothesis 3 is partially supported. These results are summarized in Table 5 including unstandardized path coefficients.

Table 6 shows that both models were highly significant ( $p < 0.001$ ). Relative chi-square of the direct model (Figure 2) was 3.48, whereas the indirect model (Figure 3) had relative chi-square 2.92, which is within prescribed limits of 3 (Kline, 1998). In addition, both models had GFI, CFI, and NFI values > 0.90, which are acceptable (Awang, 2015). The parsimonious fit measures (PGFI, PCFI and PNFI) of both models were also acceptable. However, since the mediator was not included in the direct model, its parsimonious fit measures were slightly lower. The RMSEA of the direct model was 0.08 (90%, CI: 0.04–0.13), whereas the indirect model was 0.07 (90%, CI: 0.05–0.09), showing a better fit of the indirect model (MacCallum et al., 1996).

## Discussion

This study makes several contributions to the literature on work engagement, reverse mentoring and job crafting. Most importantly, our model integrates social exchange theory

(SET) with the job demands and resources (JD-R) model to explain the important phenomena of work engagement. Based on these frameworks, we examined the linkage between job resources (reverse mentoring and job crafting) and work-related outcomes (work performance and work withdrawal behaviors), through work engagement as a mediator. We connect the previously unrelated literatures on reverse mentoring and work engagement and develop a scale for use in future reverse mentoring studies.

### Theoretical contributions

This research contributes to the literature on work engagement by integrating the JD-R model with SET to explain how individuals respond to different job resources by increasing their engagement levels. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no study in the past has combined these two models to study the antecedents and outcomes of work engagement. As job

resources, reverse mentoring (interpersonal resource) and job crafting opportunities (task or role resource) promote positive attitudes among employees in the form of competence, autonomy and relatedness, which provide motivation (Deci et al., 2001) and encourage reciprocation through working harder and producing better results.

This is one of the first empirical studies to test the association between reverse mentoring and its outcomes. We found that work engagement mediates the relationship between reverse mentoring and critical workplace outcomes (performance and withdrawal behaviors), which begins to explain the process of how reverse mentoring has its positive effects. We demonstrate that when organizations ask junior employees to take on more responsibility (as reverse mentors), not only do those employees step up to provide mentees support (Murphy, 2012) but they also improve their own engagement and performance. In addition, a reverse mentoring scale was developed and empirically validated, which can be used for future research.

Finally, we empirically demonstrate the role of work engagement in mediating the association between job resources (reverse mentoring and job crafting) and work outcomes (work performance and work withdrawal behaviors). The idea that workplace resources contribute to engagement, performance and retention is foundational to the literature on positive organizational scholarship which posits generative outcomes for organizations that focus on creating positive attributes and processes for their employees (Cameron et al., 2003). Combining a social exchange view with the predictions of the JD-R model, our study explains that reverse mentoring and job crafting are connected to performance and retention because when organizations offer such resources employees reciprocate with higher levels of work engagement.

### *Practical implications*

This study provides evidence to support practitioners in implementing resources that increase work engagement among employees. According to our study and supporting the JD-R model, resource interventions at both the individual task and role level (job crafting) and the interpersonal level (reverse mentoring) may provide important benefits. From a social exchange perspective, reverse mentoring programs and job crafting training can motivate employees to reciprocate in kind with higher levels of work engagement and consequently, improved organizational outcomes.

Reverse mentoring is an innovative method that clearly adds value to the mentees, who gain new knowledge and skills (Murphy, 2012); however, this study shows that the mentors also benefit through increased engagement, performance and reduced withdrawal behaviors. A reverse mentoring relationship serves as an interpersonal resource, which has motivating value in and of itself as a high-quality connection (Dutton and Heaphy, 2003) that furthermore provides support to enhance positive outcomes. By fostering opportunities for reverse mentoring relationships, organizations stimulate learning and connections across hierarchical levels for knowledge sharing and development.

Similarly, job crafting is a relatively new intervention for organizations who seek to empower employees through customization of their jobs (Tims et al., 2012). Through job crafting, employees can shape their role or adjust their tasks in order to focus on their strengths or areas of interest for skill development to expand their contributions to the organization. Both job crafting and reverse mentoring are developmental opportunities, which mean they foster learning and growth. In addition, both are employee-driven practices, which mean they are also economical tools for the organization in terms of both costs and resources.

### *Limitations and future research*

This study, as all research, has limitations. Our study is a cross-sectional, survey design in a technical industry. Future research with longitudinal data across industries is needed to establish causality among the variables studied and to ensure generalizability. In addition, including outcome data from other sources beyond self-report measures would strengthen

future research. Our sample is male dominated, though it is representative of the Indian IT industry where 72% of employees are men (Srinivas and Bansal, 2018). Future research may look for a more gender-balanced sample.

The reverse mentoring scale developed here was focused on the mentors in the relationship rather than the protégés, which may limit its scope of use, though it could be modified for protégés similar to traditional mentoring scales (c.f. Allen *et al.*, 2004). We suggest that future studies may want to include dyadic measures of both mentees and mentors (for example, see Murphy, 2011). In addition, researchers may consider the developmental network of employees as broader resources for work engagement (Murphy and Kram, 2014). In addition, given the nature and work environment of the IT sector, reverse mentoring mostly occurs informally as formal programs are not yet widespread in India. Future research in a context where reverse mentoring has been popularized formally as well as supported by an inclusive, low power distance culture would significantly add to the literature and further validate the findings of the current study. Moreover, future research may explore the linkage of SET with individual dimensions of work engagement, as compared to a composite aggregation measure in this study, so as to further unpack the association. In addition, Tims *et al.* (2015) suggests the presence of a positive gain spiral between job crafting and work engagement. While testing this positive gain spiral or reverse causality of engagement with job crafting and/or reverse mentoring was beyond the scope of our study, future work may explore and unfold these associations.

## Conclusion

This study integrates social exchange theory (SET) with the job demands-resources model (JD-R) to examine the mediating role of work engagement in the association of reverse mentoring and job crafting with work performance and work withdrawal behavior. In addition, this is the first empirical study to develop and validate a reverse mentoring support scale and to offer insights into how reverse mentoring can foster positive work outcomes. Overall, our results demonstrate that employee-driven job resources are effective practices to improve work engagement and outcomes.
