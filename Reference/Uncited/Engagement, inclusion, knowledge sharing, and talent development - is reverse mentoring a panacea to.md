## Abstract

**Purpose** – The purpose of this study is to systematically review the practice of reverse mentoring and draw a timeline of the research over the past two decades. Considering the novelty of this intervention, this paper proposed an agenda for future research on this burgeoning topic.

**Design/methodology/approach** – By adopting narrative literature review and Gregory and Denniss' (2018) four-step process, this paper reviewed 54 studies grounded in conceptual, literature review and empirical research published between 1998 and 2020.

**Findings** – The articles included in the literature review on reverse mentoring research were summarized according to journal publications, research methodologies, contextual settings, theoretical framework, purpose and outcomes. Reverse mentoring studies are dominantly published in educational journals using primarily qualitative and conceptual approaches to explore both academic and business contexts within the USA and Europe. Theories frequently used to frame and examine the need of reverse mentoring included social exchange theory and leader-member exchange theory. The fundamental purpose of reverse mentoring research is to transfer knowledge and to bridge the technology divide between intergenerational groups. Reverse mentoring has been used to promote inclusivity between multiple generations in relation to gender, ethnicity and culture.

**Originality/value** – As per the knowledge, this is the first-ever comprehensive English summary of reverse mentoring research done in the past two decades. Findings from this research can be used to better understand reverse mentoring research trends and directions.

## Introduction

The age-old adage, “experience is the best teacher” may not hold true in this fast-paced world where technological advances are changing the world of work so much so that a fair

amount of knowledge resides within the younger generation. Besides technology, organizations are grappling with retaining the millennials, mostly identified as job hoppers as they tend to switch jobs every 12 to 18 months (Nolan, 2015). The challenge of retaining millennials who have superior technological skills is further aggravated by the exodus of the baby boomers, who retire at the rate of 10,000 employees per day (United States Census Bureau, 2015). This presents a unique double-barreled challenge for organizations to retain organizational knowledge as the brain drain is bidirectional – on one hand, the majority of the baby boomer population nearing retirement age is taking with them a vast repository of organizational knowledge and on the other, the younger population mostly the millennials are in the race of growing fast, and as a result, are chronic job hoppers. To address this quintessential challenge, many scholars have proffered inter-generational learning (Chaudhuri, S., 2019; Ropes, 2013) as an option to retain the millennials and to engage the boomers. Reverse mentoring, an inverted form of mentoring whereby the seasoned and more experienced workers are paired as mentees with organizational rookies, who are mostly fresh and less experienced as mentors, has become a sought-after intervention to bridge the inter-generational knowledge gap (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Hechl, 2017; Murphy, 2012). Reverse mentoring works best when younger, newer and more junior employees in the organization have expertise in one domain (e.g. technological skills, social-media skills, subject matter advances, diversity and inclusion issues, openness to work-life balance, etc.) and they are willingly open to sharing that knowledge with their more experienced and seasoned senior colleagues. This also facilitates the leadership development of millennials as they get heightened visibility and access to organizational knowledge working with senior colleagues (Murphy, 2012).

## Problem statement

It is little over two decades that the practice of reverse mentoring was first institutionalized by the late chief executive officer (CEO) of General Electric, Jack Welch. Given the efficacy of this practice, there has been enough enthusiasm amid both academicians and practitioners. Though there is no denying that practice of reverse mentoring preceded the academic literature on the topic, the scholarly community is witnessing a surge of academic literature on reverse mentoring, approximately after 10 years of its introduction in practice. As a result, we are seeing two streams of literature developing parallelly – one from the practitioners' community and the other from the academics. While the practitioner's literature mainly focuses on anecdotal evidence of how reverse mentoring is making a headway in many progressive organizations including Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Unilever, International business machines corporation (IBM), Target, United health group (UHG) and Dell to name a few, the academic literature so far has mostly been conceptual with a handful of empirical studies. Moreover, given the novelty of this intervention, many organizations are still exploring how reverse mentoring can be innovatively institutionalized organization wide, the benefits of which can go far beyond technology. A careful perusal of both practitioner and academic literature reveals that reverse mentoring has been successfully used in the area of diversity and inclusion (Madison, 2019; Raza and Onyesoh, 2020; Stüss-Stepancik and Permoser, 2017), leadership (Gabriel et al., 2020; Kulseza and Smith, 2013), engagement (Biss and DuFrene, 2006; Boysen et al., 2016; Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012), communication (Breck et al., 2018; Gabriel et al., 2020), social media and subject matter advances (Breck et al., 2018; Gabriel et al., 2020; Leedahl et al., 2019) and of course technology (Alvarez et al., 2005; Augustiniënè and Ciüciulkienè, 2013). It should also be noted that most of the literature on reverse mentoring is originating from the West and the research is still inconclusive if the intervention would work in the eastern hemisphere,

where the concept of role reversal in a reverse mentoring dyad is antithetical to the deeply espoused notion of hierarchy. Moreover, in the burgeoning literature of reverse mentoring, social exchange theory and leader-member exchange (LMX) has been predominantly used as the theoretical framework, while some of the recent studies have used different frameworks including developmental network theory and behavioral management theory. As is evident from the discussion above, there is no conclusive findings in the academic literature till date, which summarizes the highlight of two decades of research that has taken place in this area.

Although Garg and Singh (2019) consolidated the research on reverse mentoring in their paper titled, “reverse mentoring: a review of the extant literature and recent trends,” their study focused more on what differentiates reverse mentoring from traditional mentoring, how it can offer multi-faceted benefits beyond technology and some of its potential threats, than a comprehensive review. Our study takes a completely fresh perspective and is a rigorous endeavor to synthesize the theoretical and empirical research of the still unfolding literature around reverse mentoring from an academic perspective. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the practice of reverse mentoring and draw a timeline of the research in the past two decades since its introduction in 1998. We investigate the underlying theories as indicated in the extant literature, review the existing research both with respect to qualitative and quantitative findings, summarize the fields where the practice is more prevalent and provide a list of outcome variables impacted by the practice. Therefore, the two research questions guiding this study are:

Q1. How has the research on reverse mentoring evolved since its inception in 1998 to date?

Q2. What are some of the research trends and directions as informed by the current research?

The significance of this study lies in providing a comprehensive summary of reverse mentoring research to better understand its research trends and directions by outlining the publication outlet, research methodologies, contextual settings, theoretical framework, mentoring dyads and purpose and outcomes of reverse mentoring. By reviewing academic publications for 20 years, this study can contribute to identifying the main themes in the current reverse mentoring research and suggest a future research agenda.

## Methods

We adopted a narrative literature review approach to summarize and synthesize the findings from the previous literature to update knowledge on reverse mentoring (Gregory and Denniss, 2018; Paré et al., 2015). Narrative review can provide a strong foundation for developing new theoretical perspectives on the current topic (Aloini et al., 2007). This approach helps researchers understand a wider perspective on the topic and bring certain matters and concerns into view (Green et al., 2006) and be flexible to design the review strategy to identify and select related studies (Grant and Booth, 2009). To conduct the literature review, we found existing studies through multiple databases, including *Academic Search Complete*, *American Psychological Association Psych Info*, *Business Source Complete*, *EBSCO*, *Eric*, *Google Scholar*, *JSTOR*, *PsycARTICLES*, *PubMed* and *Scopus*. The search was conducted using the following keywords and mixed terms within the title, keywords or abstracts, namely, “reverse mentoring” and “reverse mentorship.”

We followed four steps to review the literature based on Gregory and Denniss’ (2018) four-step process. First, we defined the topic and audience, searched related studies using

the databases and keywords. The initial findings resulted in 3,020 studies on reverse mentoring. Second, we screened 136 articles for review after excluding 22 duplicated articles and 2,862 studies published in books, book chapters or proceedings. Third, we selected 54 studies based on the following criteria, namely, peer-reviewed scholarly articles; studies grounded in conceptual, literature review or empirical research; and articles published between 1998 and 2020. The year 1998 was used as the starting point of the search because reverse mentoring was introduced in 1998 (Cotugna and Vickery, 1998). Fourth, we conducted an in-depth review and analysis of the 54 articles that were identified as relevant to this study. We coded the articles by author(s), year published, title, journal name, theoretical framework, research methods, related variables if quantitative studies (independent variables, dependent variables, mediating variables and moderating variables), the purpose of reverse mentoring, outcomes, description of participants, setting and country contexts. All this information was included in an Excel worksheet. Figure 1 showed our literature review process.

## Findings

Our analysis of the findings is presented using a historical perspective to illustrate how academic research on reverse mentoring has emerged and progressed since its inception. The findings are organized using the following subheadings, namely, journal publications, research methodologies, contextual settings, theoretical framework, reverse mentoring dyads and purpose and outcomes.

## Journal publications

The earliest article on reverse mentoring, published in the *Journal of the American Dietetic Association*, dates back to 1998 with a focus on using this technique to teach technology to dieticians who were educated and trained before technological advances. Dieticians were paired with technologically-savvy college nutrition majors who took on the role of

technology mentors to the dietetic seniors (Cotugna and Vickery, 1998). Although the oldest article in our data set was published in 1998, there was a time gap before other research was published in 2005 (Álvarez et al., 2005; Christie et al., 2005; Leh, 2005; Murphy and Adams, 2005). Furthermore, it was not until after a decade, from 1998, that the concept gained increased interest in the academic sphere. A total of 54 articles are included in the data set for our study and over 80% of the articles have been published since 2010. It is important to note that the vast majority of the articles (75%) have been published within the past five years, since 2015.

We found that, over the years, the concept and practice of reverse mentoring have been explored across a variety of disciplinary fields sharing a similar purpose as the first published study – to transfer technology-related knowledge among intergenerational groups. As the basic tenet of reverse mentoring is learning, research was first explored in the discipline of education. Then, researchers within businesses realized the importance of the concept because of the role of learning in the growth and competitiveness of organizations. Reverse mentoring further expanded to medicine and health-care, a field that is increasingly dominated by technological advances. This is reflected in the wide cross-section of journals that have served as outlets to disseminate knowledge and build on the theory and practice of reverse mentoring. The majority of articles have been published traditionally in education journals (e.g. *Journal of Education*, *Journal of Teacher Education*, *Business Education Digest*, *Innovative Higher Education and Journal of Higher Education*, *Journal of Technology and Teacher Education* and *Open Online Journal of Research and Education*) and the social sciences including business, leadership, management, finance, marketing, human resource development, human resource management and psychology journals (for example – *Social Science*, *Scientific Bulletin-Economic Sciences*, *Human Resource Development Review*, *New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development*, *Learning and Development in Organizations*, *Management Today*, *Journal of Management and Organization*, *Human Resource Management*, *Journal of Organizational Psychology and Case Studies in Business and Management*). More recently, an increasing number of studies have also been published in medical and health-related journals, including areas such as gerontology and geriatrics (*Advances in Medical Education and Practice*, *Future Health-care Journal*, *Journal of Gerontology and The Gerontologist*). Even more recently, we found that reverse mentoring studies are published in a wider range of journals including the arts and humanities such as literacy and linguistics journals (*Journal of Media Literacy Education* and *Columbian Applied Linguistics Journal*).

## Research methodologies

The first published study in 1998 was analyzed using basic descriptive statistics, a quantitative methodological approach. As the research on reverse mentoring progressed, we found that the majority of articles used qualitative research (40%) and conceptual frameworks (34%). Far fewer number of studies adopted quantitative (13%), mixed-method (7%) and literature review (6%) approaches. The qualitative studies adopted various epistemological methodologies including phenomenology (Breck et al., 2018), ethnography (Raza and Onyesoh, 2020), case studies (Burdett, 2014; Cismaru and Iunius, 2020; Gündüz and Akşit, 2018; Tayşır and Ulgen, 2017; Madison, 2019), reflection (Augustiniéné and Ciuciulienė, 2013), observation (Christie et al., 2005; Gabriel et al., 2020) and individual and group interviews (Álvarez et al., 2005; Chen, 2013; Hays and Swanson, 2012; Gadomska-Lila, 2020; Spradley and Towns, 2016). A number of the articles published on reverse mentoring were not data-driven but were written using an original conceptual idea that provided a framework and opportunity for new research (Baily, 2009; Bolser and Gosciej, 2015; Boysen

*et al.*, 2016; Brinzea, 2018; Chaudhuri, 2019; Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Harvey *et al.*, 2009; Lawrence, 2017; Morris, 2017; Murphy, 2012; Napier, 2006; Sanner-Stiehr and Vandermause, 2017; Zauschner-Studnicka, 2017). Few studies have been found to use a mixed-method approach to measure the effectiveness of reverse mentoring (Chen, 2018; Leedahl *et al.*, 2019; Leh, 2005; Porras *et al.*, 2018). The quantitative studies have been mainly descriptive using survey and cross-sectional research designs, quasi-experimental design and regression analysis (Biss and DuFrene, 2006; Chen, 2014, 2015; Hechl, 2017).

## *Contextual settings*

Over the years, reverse mentoring expanded its reach beyond the western world and is being practiced fairly widely. A total of 26 studies in our data set were conducted in the USA where the concept originated while 18 studies were investigated in European countries including the UK, Turkey, Switzerland, Austria and Australia. We found that nine studies were conducted in Asian cultures such as Vietnam, India, Taiwan and the Philippines. Very recently, the concept has also been explored in Columbia in South America. Reverse mentorship gained attention fairly early on in non-western countries primarily because of globalization and its impact on interaction and economic growth and the increase of interactions between different regions across the world. For example, in 2005, reverse mentoring was explored in the UK (Murphy and Adams, 2005) and shortly after in Vietnam (Napier, 2006). Our findings showed that although the majority of studies were conducted in the USA, the concept became recognized in academic research in other parts of the world just about the same time it started gaining popularity in the USA, from 2005 and onwards.

These studies have been conducted in a variety of settings and sectors, namely: education – from K-12 to higher education (14) (Alvarez *et al.*, 2005; Augustinié and Ciučiulienė, 2013; Leh, 2005), business (11) (Bolser and Gosciej, 2015; Boyle, 2019; Chen, 2013), health care (6) (Murphy and Adams, 2005; Raza and Onyesoh, 2020), banking (2) (Tayşır and Ülgen, 2017), information and communication technology (2) (Stüss-Stepancik and Permoser, 2017), government (2) (Burdett, 2014; Gabriel *et al.*, 2020), public relations (1) (Hays and Swanson, 2012), and hospitality (1) (Cismaru and Iunius, 2020). Some of the studies included in our data set did not specify contextual setting.

## *Theoretical framework*

A broad spectrum of theoretical frameworks has been used to guide and analyze studies on reverse mentoring. It is also important to note that while a number of recent studies are framed using various theories, most of the earlier research was not grounded in a theoretical framework. Reverse mentoring has been used traditionally as a social exchange tool to leverage the expertise of generations. For a number of studies on reverse mentoring, we found that the social exchange theory and LMX theory have been used as the theoretical framework in which to ground studies (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Flinchbaugh *et al.*, 2018; Gündüz and Akşit, 2018; Hechl, 2017).

Other studies have used developmental theories, learning theories (Boysen *et al.*, 2016; Clarke *et al.*, 2019; Leedahl *et al.*, 2019; Leh, 2005; Zauschner-Studnicka, 2017), career development theory (Boyle, 2019), organizational age theory (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012) and behavioral management theories (Gabriel *et al.*, 2020) as foundational and underlying theories for conducting research on reverse mentoring. We also found that recent studies have used models such as structured on-the-job training (Chen, 2018) and the technological acceptance model (Kaše *et al.*, 2019) to guide the research. Also, in recent years, we saw where studies have been linked to extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in the reverse

mentoring process. The use of theories in reverse mentoring is expanding as more inroads are being made into this practice.

### *Reverse mentoring dyads*

Reverse mentoring dyads have included a wide cross-section of individuals in various roles and capacities at varying levels in organizations. For reverse mentoring to come to fruition, special attention has been given to selecting the dyads and the topics. For example, in the field of higher education, graduate students with digital literacy were paired with senior faculty members in the same department (Alvarez et al., 2005) so that the senior faculty members can enhance their pedagogical skills from the able guidance of their junior mentors. In a business setting, the human resource department carefully chooses senior mentees from senior leadership positions based on their own willingness to participate in such an initiative. Interestingly enough, special attention is being paid to select the reverse mentoring dyads from different departments and different backgrounds (Tayşır and Ülgen, 2017). The topics varied in range too from digitization, leadership, general expectations of the newer generation, to subject matter advances (Kaše et al., 2019; Tayşır and Ülgen, 2017). In a few studies, a neutral setting was preferred away from the confines of the office building as it might perpetuate the hierarchy and the power distance that existed between the senior mentees and the junior mentors.

The range of reverse mentoring partners have included the following dyads (with mentors listed first), namely, graduate students and faculty, Generation Y students and graduate students, pre- and in-service teachers, Generation X/millennials/Generation Z, junior employees and senior employees up to chief executive officer (CEO) level, information technology medical students and senior clinicians in health-care, foreigners/expatriates and host country workers, black and minority staff and senior white leaders, black Asian minority ethnic peers and Caucasians.

## *Purpose and outcomes*

Most of the studies included in our data set revealed that the primary objective of reverse mentoring research was to transfer knowledge and to bridge the technology divide between intergenerational groups (Alvarez et al., 2005; Augustiniene and Čiūciulienė, 2013; Christie et al., 2005; Flinchbaugh et al., 2018). Another primary traditional objective of using the reverse mentoring technique is to manage and develop the talents of multiple generational groups in organizations to leverage their expertise, as well as to alleviate difficulties in managing different generations (Chen, 2013, 2015; Cismaru and Iunius, 2020). Some of the noted outcomes of reverse mentoring is along the lines of developing leaders and leadership competency (Gabriel et al., 2020; Kulseza and Smith, 2013), increasing employee engagement, learning and performance (Biss and DuFrene, 2006; Boysen et al., 2016), improving workplace culture and team development needed for business success (Alvarez et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2019; Gadomska-Lila, 2020). Studies also revealed that reverse mentoring is practiced to break down traditional educational borders and promote collaborative learning experiences (Christie et al., 2005). This technique is also used to enhance cross-cultural learning (Napier, 2006).

More recently, reverse mentoring is being practiced in more creative and innovative ways beyond its traditional/original purpose to address critical workplace issues on diversity and inclusion. For example, later studies showed where reverse mentoring is used as a learning tool to educate more privileged groups (Caucasians) within the workplace to gain in-depth understanding of the experiences of minority and underrepresented individuals to aid in closing the gaps within biased systems ingrained in organizations

(Madison, 2019; Raza and Onyesoh, 2020; Stuss-Stepancik and Permoser, 2017). We also found that within the past two years, reverse mentoring has been used as an intervention in universities to help students from minority ethnic communities to improve on goal attainment and cultural understanding (Peterson and Ramsay, 2020). Reverse mentoring is also used to alleviate the social isolation of older adults and increase their sense of self-efficacy as they build their confidence in technological use. In this mentoring relationship, younger adults develop leadership, communication, problem-solving and teaching skills (Breck *et al.*, 2018; Gabriel *et al.*, 2020; Leedahl *et al.*, 2019).

Based on our review, we summarized the findings in Table 1 with five categories mentioned above.

## Discussion and implications

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the origins, growth and dissemination of reverse mentoring, a practice that was being popularized way back in 1999, by the Ex-CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Although the first academic paper on reverse mentoring was published in 1998, what is noteworthy is that the extant academic and practitioner literature on reverse mentoring credits General Electric with the first widespread formal implementation of reverse mentoring. Though Jack Welch formalized the concept of reverse mentoring, reverse mentoring was first implemented at the University of

Summary of the findings on reverse mentoring research

Delaware, Newark where 28 students in a nutrition education course were paired with dieticians who declared themselves as internet novices ([Cotugna and Vickery, 1998](#)). The first ever reverse mentoring project was executed in a 2.5h workshop focused on teaching internet skills to dietetics professionals who have been practicing in the field for more than 10 years. It is indeed revealing to note that after the introduction of this novel idea in 1998 by [Cotugna and Vickery \(1998\)](#), there was an absolute dearth of academic studies for the next seven years. The newness of this intervention with the fact that it was challenging the traditional notion of mentoring coupled with lack of theoretical framework might have raised questions on the validity and relevance of this intervention.

Additionally, the paucity of formal implementation of this intervention restricted access to any real-time data. This might explain why academicians were slow in jumping into this bandwagon while the world of practice was enamored by it. What is also disconcerting is though the novel idea of reverse mentoring was proffered by [Cotugna and Vickery in 1998](#), a year before when Jack Welch popularized it by executing the intervention in his organization, these two scholars are hardly given any credit for this novel intervention. Instead, [Murphy \(2012\)](#) with more than 350 citations and [Chaudhuri and Ghosh \(2012\)](#) with more than 250 citations are often quoted in popular media talking about its impact and proliferation. Considering that [Cotugna and Vickery](#) had successfully executed the reverse mentoring idea back in 1998, it is worth noting that, in contrast, their publication has been cited only 43 times as of the time our literature review study was conducted.

As noted in findings, though reverse mentoring found its first application in the field of science and was published in a health-related journal, it started sprawling into multiple disciplines and fields, the most prominent being the disciplines of education and management. This did not come as a surprise as with the influx of online education and increased accessibility of the internet in the early 2000s ([Karber, 2003](#)), many seasoned tenured faculty found themselves at the crossroads when they were being asked to teach online, which was antithetical to their existing classroom pedagogy. Existing literature on the adoption of integrating technology in the classrooms is rife with stories where faculty members were skeptical about online education as it is at odds with liberal learning ([Carstens and Knowles, 2000](#)). However, [Moore \(2001\)](#) confirmed that if faculty members are adequately supported with resources, they are often not reluctant to the use of technology in their classrooms. With this knowledge, [Alvarez \(2005\)](#) with her colleagues became the pioneers in trying out reverse mentoring in an educational setting at the University of Delaware and Bowling Green State University where they were being reverse mentored by technologically literate graduate students in English who helped them developing online courses for the first time. It could be a mere coincidence but both the academic studies on reverse mentoring came out from the University of Delaware, one from the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics and another from the Department of English. The successful intervention of reverse mentoring both in academic settings and business setting led by Jack Welch set the foundation for reverse mentoring to be applied in multiple industries and multiple contexts.

As noted in our findings, now reverse mentoring is being implemented in various sectors including banking, information and technology sectors, retail, public relations, health sciences and medicine, to name a few. In the future, reverse mentoring can be expanded to other sectors, such as military, police and family education. In the military context, reverse mentoring can be an intervention to help discharged soldiers and retired veterans develop their careers in civil society by pairing them with civilians who are interested in supporting and working with veterans and working. In the law enforcement sector, reverse mentoring could be implemented to help the diverse underrepresented groups (e.g. women, black and

minority) promote to leadership positions. In a family setting, reverse mentoring could provide opportunities to teenagers to build stable relationships and communicate with their parents by using the topics teenagers know well and feel confident about.

The underlying purpose of reverse mentoring, which initially had a narrow technology focus has broadened over the years with many organizations reaping its benefits in solving a myriad of organizational problems such as employee engagement (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Murphy, 2012), employee attrition (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Murphy, 2012), diversity and inclusion (Peterson and Ramsay, 2020; Raza and Onyesoh, 2020), leadership (Gabriel *et al.*, 2020; Harrison, 2017) and communication issues (Boysen *et al.*, 2016). It is indeed revealing to trace the usage of reverse mentoring from the point of its inception to the current day where reverse mentoring has been used in a much more innovative way to close the diversity gap between the junior and the senior employees. As noted in our findings, traditionally reverse mentoring has been considered to be an effective intervention in closing the generation gap by targeted skill development of the senior employees to bring them up to speed with technology (Alvarez *et al.*, 2005; Burdett, 2014; Cotugna and Vickery, 1998; Kaše *et al.*, 2019; Murphy and Adams, 2005) and more recently with social media skills (Gündüz and Akşit, 2018; Hays and Swanson, 2012; Kaše *et al.*, 2019; Morris, 2017; Tayşır and Ülgen, 2017). In the light of this review, we can predict that as long as technology keeps evolving, reverse mentoring will continue to find its application in organizations that are progressive and more technology dependent.

Additionally, one of the more compelling and optimistic applications of this intervention is how reverse mentoring is being used to challenge the status quo around diversity and inclusion. Very recently, many organizations have used reverse mentoring to create more awareness around people of color and embark on conversations around racial inequality (Peterson and Ramsay, 2020). Peterson and Ramsay (2020) reported huge impacts on both groups, the senior leaders who were paired with Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic students in higher education. Raza and Onyesoh (2020) also reported how reverse mentoring can be applied to equality, diversity and inclusion programs by pairing black and minority ethnic staff to explore senior white leaders' practices on how they instill equality within their organizational culture. It is indeed interesting to note the gradual change in the reverse mentoring dyad, which initially had a tech savvy junior mentor and technologically challenged senior mentee to a more recent black, and under-represented minority mentor and white senior mentee. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that as long as there are employees from diverse groups, reverse mentoring would continue to exist and provide an effective tool to the Human Resource Development professionals to deal with sensitive organizational issues related to diversity and inclusion.

Our findings indicate that most reverse mentoring studies lean toward qualitative methods. Because research on reverse mentoring is still in its infancy, an exploratory research method such as qualitative and grounded theory approach is deemed more appropriate, thus providing novel and rich insights on this phenomenon. Additionally, given the newness of this intervention and its non-traditional focus, organizations are extremely cautious with organization-wide implementation as there are many uncertainties surrounding this practice. Therefore, many organizations pilot this intervention with 8 to 10 pairs to begin with, followed by multiple-year pilots before implementing it across the entire organization. As a result, not many employees have personal experience of reverse mentoring thereby limiting the sample pool. This could, perhaps, explain why we witness only a handful of quantitative studies in reverse mentoring due to the lack of subjects needed for a quantitative study. To adopt and develop various other research methods in reverse mentoring, it would be a good start to collect different cases, episodes and anecdotes

about reverse mentoring in various organizations and contexts by using standardized criteria and matrix to identify and compare the features of reverse mentoring.

In the past few years, there is a surge toward adopting positivistic epistemologies demonstrating that researchers are beginning to explore multiple methodologies to test and validate the concept. The challenge is further aggravated due to the lack of consensus on a unified reverse mentoring scale that is rigorous and unanimously being approved by researchers. To date, none of the quantitative studies except one used a scale that was developed specifically to measure reverse mentoring. Chen (2014) proposed a reverse mentoring scale using purposive sampling with 158 samples from various Information technology (IT) Taiwanese organizations, however the study specifically stated its lack of generalizability and applicability to other industries and countries. This clearly speaks to the importance of developing a valid and reliable reverse mentoring scale that can be confidently used to promote more quantitative study in this area. Of the 7% of the studies in our findings, which used quantitative methods, most of them were descriptive studies using surveys and quasi-experimental designs, with only a couple using regression analysis. This further supports the lack of a valid scale to measuring the reverse mentoring concept.

The theoretical framework used in the reverse mentoring studies are expanding as more inroads are being made into this practice. Earlier studies primarily focused on social exchange theory, LMX and organizational-age theory. However, in recent years as reverse mentoring is becoming more prevalent, researchers have started taking a peak into these relationships in the light of developmental network theories with a complementary and dyadic lens focused on learning partnerships (Clarke *et al.*, 2019; Zauschner-Studnicka, 2017). More specifically, some of the recent theoretical frameworks are embracing the idea of learning partnership between generations as the focus has shifted toward inter-generational learning (Gadomska-Lila, 2020; Satterly *et al.*, 2018). The move toward using theories that is focused on inter-generational learning is timely given the exodus of 10,000 Baby Boomers every day who are taking away with them a vast amount of tacit organizational knowledge (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012). Formalizing a reverse mentoring initiative, which is grounded in intergenerational knowledge transfer will help address this crisis.

As indicated in our findings, though reverse mentoring witnessed its inception in the USA, other western countries were quick to embrace this intervention. The first reported academic study outside the USA was reported in the UK in 2005 in the field of health sciences, where 20–23 years old IT-literate medical students were being asked to train senior clinicians on the use of technology (Murphy and Adams, 2005). Since then, reverse mentoring has been used as an intervention in various other European studies. The proliferation of this intervention has been somewhat slower in many Asian countries, with many still oblivious to this intervention. Though the awareness of this intervention was created fairly early in the process because of globalization, social media and technological advances, the first reported study in Asia was conducted in Vietnam in 2006 as a conceptual paper (Napier, 2006). It was not until 2013 when Chen (2013, 2014; 2015) conducted a series of empirical studies around reverse mentoring in Taiwan. Given the non-traditional nature of reverse mentoring, it is not surprising that the adoption of this practice has been slow with a few of the Asian countries where hierarchy is still respected and power distance is on the higher side between the superiors and the subordinates. It would be extremely arduous for people in power to openly admit that they lack certain skills and make themselves vulnerable to junior employees (Chaudhuri and Ghosh, 2012; Murphy, 2012). At the same time, it would be equally challenging for junior members in the organization to question the status quo and teach senior employees the skills they lack. However, on one hand, younger

employees' savviness with technology and on the other, the senior employees' reluctance to adopt technology may provide that fertile middle ground for reverse mentoring to thrive.

Borrowing from the integrative literature review done by Bian and Wang (2019), we recommend future research in three specific areas, namely, research scope including both content and context, theory development and research design. It should be noted that the recommendations proposed by us are by no means all-encompassing rather an honest attempt to brainstorm ideas that might be worth investigating for future research.

## *Research scope*

In the future, the scope of reverse mentoring research can be expanded. Based on our findings, researchers can analyze the specific contexts of each study in more detail to understand different situations adopted in reverse mentoring. Additional reviews can be conducted by analyzing critical factors and points discussed in each empirical and conceptual research examined in our review to advance our knowledge of the features of reverse mentoring. Cross-cultural studies and in-depth case studies to observe how reverse mentoring is implemented and linked to organizational outcomes may also be helpful to further improve our understanding of reverse mentoring practice. Cross-cultural studies can be undertaken in multinational organizations that have implemented this practice globally. Similarly, comparative studies between different sectors and different organizations could throw an interesting perspective on this novel practice. Further research can illustrate the processes affecting reverse mentoring in organizations by exploring individual factors, contextual aspects and their interactions. Dyadic interactions can be further explored with mentors from underrepresented populations and straight mentees, minority mentors with majority mentees, disabled mentors with non-disabled mentees. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the topic of informal reverse mentoring is mostly missing from the extant literature. Future research could look into this phenomenon of informal reverse mentoring, which likely is extremely widespread but often goes unnoticed. Along similar lines, more research is warranted where reverse mentoring could be investigated from a relational mentoring perspective as the sustenance of the relationship will depend on the quality of the exchanges happening in the mentoring dyad. Reverse mentoring episodes are also a topic that has remained untouched and can be further explored as new research on mentoring unfolds.

### *Theory development*

As aforementioned, only a few theories including social exchange theory, LMX theory and organizational age theory has been consistently used to study the phenomenon of reverse mentoring. Given that reverse mentoring has been innovatively used by many organizations to address motivation, engagement, leadership and diversity and inclusion issues, there is a need to integrate a sound theoretical framework to further ground the studies of reverse mentoring in established theories. In our current review, less than 40% of the studies used some kind of theory, the rest did not. Given that the field of Human resource development (HRD) is often considered to be confusing and elusive, it is all the more important that an Human resource development (HRD) intervention like reverse mentoring should use well-developed theories for any kind of analysis (Bian and Wang, 2019; Chalofsky, 2004). Additionally, for future research, theories related to co-worker support, job resources, intergenerational learning, knowledge transfer, motivation to learn, fear of negative evaluation, shame and embarrassment should be further investigated to expand the current theory base.

## *Research design*

There is a strong need for empirical research to not only further the concept of reverse mentoring but to gain the confidence of the scholars and practitioners on the efficacy of this intervention. The existing literature on this topic is overwhelmed with conceptual pieces with only half of them using data from the field. Unfortunately, the empirical research is rudimentary in most of the cases, which is stemming from the lack of proper scale in the case of quantitative research, limited to surveys and descriptive statistics. Similarly, qualitative research lacks methodological rigor, which by far is restricted to interviews and focus groups mostly with the exception of two studies that used ethnographic and phenomenological approaches. There is definitely a need for more inductive methodologies to probe deeper into this intervention as the research on reverse mentoring is still in its infancy. More case studies and in-depth observation on participants' motivation to learn, personality traits and behavior change can throw further light on this topic. Finally, longitudinal studies will help measuring the long-term impact of having a reverse mentor on mentees' change in behavior and skills.

## Limitations

This study has several limitations. Our review focused on 54 studies published in English in academic venues and did not include magazines, technical reports and essays for practitioners. With the key term "reverse mentoring" in the title, keywords or abstracts, we did not cover academic publications about intergenerational learning, reciprocal mentoring and bidirectional mentoring, broader terms including reverse mentoring. Although we identified different contexts and settings used in reverse mentoring, our findings could be expanded with a wider and deeper analysis of the contexts. Finally, we identified the outcomes of reverse mentoring and did not discuss other variables affecting reverse mentoring and its outcomes in each study.

## Concluding thoughts

Reverse mentoring is here to stay. As long as there are digital innovations and subject matter advances taking place coupled with globalization, equality and equity issues, the new generation coming into the workplace will be equipped with newer insights, advanced skills and fresh perspectives that the previous generation does not have. This would mean the generations prior have to always play the catch-up game and reverse mentoring could be offered as a panacea by the Human resource development (HRD) and Human resource management (HRM) professionals to help bridge the gap. The research on reverse mentoring is still blossoming and there are more questions and areas that are still unexplored and unanswered. As more organizations embrace this concept, we are optimistic that new frontiers will be opened in the scholarship of reverse mentoring.
