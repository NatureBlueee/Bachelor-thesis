Work Values of Gen Z Business Students  

**Understanding the Work Values of Gen Z Business Students**

**Abstract**

The next generation (i.e., post-Millennials/Gen Z) now represents a majority of our business students. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence of the career expectations of this emerging generation, thereby impeding our ability to effectively engage students both in the classroom and in the career development process. To overcome this gap, we surveyed business students at seven different U.S. universities to assess their career work expectations. The results show broad similarities between Gen Z and the prior Gen Y generation yet also highlight some meaningful, significant variations. Supporting and extending existing literature, the results depict a typical business student who focuses on a stable career by developing strong skillsets that allow them to advance quickly in the workplace. A follow up survey of business faculty and career service personnel reveals that both groups are relatively out of touch with such student expectations. Specific recommendations are subsequently provided to enable business faculty to enrich student interest in their courses as well as help academic programs and career services enhance the fit of these students with majors and careers.

**Highlights**

- Limited research examines work values of current business students.
- A survey reveals that students seek strong skills sets for advancement and stability.
- Faculty and career development do not fully understand student work values.
- We present ideas to support faculty, academic programs, and career services.

1. **Introduction**

The Millennial (Gen Y) generation represents the largest segment of the existing professional workforce, recently surpassing retiring Baby Boomers ([Fry, 2015](#_enref_27 "Fry, 2015 #450")). The next generation (post-Millennials, Gen Z) however, are now in college and will also soon be impacting the workforce ([Knapp, Weber, & Moellenkamp, 2017](#_enref_44 "Knapp, 2017 #436")). Popular press has espoused significant differences of these younger generations from older generations in the workplace, leading practitioners to hastily stereotype younger workers ([Parry & Urwin, 2011](#_enref_72 "Parry, 2011 #76"); [Sullivan, Forret, Carraher, & Mainiero, 2009](#_enref_90 "Sullivan, 2009 #72")). Employers have subsequently developed concerns about managing young employees, labeling their expectations as excessive and questioning their preparation for workplace realities ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287"); [Ng, Schweitzer, & Lyons, 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14")). 

As a result, we must continually evaluate the work values of our college students. While many past studies have examined Gen Y work values, very few focus on the current generation in college (Gen Z) or specifically on business students. Moreover, many of the empirical findings about generational differences can seemingly be contradictory ([Deal, Altman, & Rogelberg, 2010](#_enref_18 "Deal, 2010 #301"); [Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")). Ultimately, managers may not clearly understand generational differences or subsequent actions to take to address these differences ([Urick, Hollensbe, Masterson, & Lyons, 2017](#_enref_101 "Urick, 2017 #306")). 

Investigating Gen Z work values as well as the associated perceptions of their university professors and career counselors therefore offers several contributions. First, faculty can use the results to enrich our awareness of generational differences ([Lyons, Urick, Kuron, & Schweitzer, 2015](#_enref_57 "Lyons, 2015 #294"); [Urick, et al., 2017](#_enref_101 "Urick, 2017 #306")). We can then capitalize on such knowledge to increase student comprehension, enthusiasm, productivity, and satisfaction ([Sullivan, et al., 2009](#_enref_90 "Sullivan, 2009 #72")). Similarly, stronger understanding of student work values allows academic programs to better market classes and majors, allowing them to attract more students to particular majors. 

Most importantly, the results can help career services and academic programs better support students during the career search process. “Newcomers to the labor market often take longer than regular job seekers to find a suitable job, are more likely to experience a job mismatch and to suffer from underemployment,” ([Koen, Klehe, & Van Vianen, 2012, p. 395](#_enref_45 "Koen, 2012 #476")). While students report substantial stress with career selection, many do not seek assistance from university career services ([Dey & Cruzvergara, 2014](#_enref_21 "Dey, 2014 #479"); [Fouad et al., 2006](#_enref_26 "Fouad, 2006 #475")). As career services and academic programs better understand student career expectations, they can develop career interventions to meaningfully counsel students towards best-fit careers and vocational identities, helping to overcome a perceived inability to deliver on students’ expectations ([Holland, Johnston, & Asama, 1993](#_enref_35 "Holland, 1993 #481"); [Pfeffer & Fong, 2004](#_enref_74 "Pfeffer, 2004 #386"); [Scott & Ciani, 2008](#_enref_85 "Scott, 2008 #474")).

`	`Finally, factors including lower birth rates and expanding requisite skill sets have created a professional workforce shortage ([Burke & Ng, 2006](#_enref_8 "Burke, 2006 #384"); [Helyer & Lee, 2012](#_enref_32 "Helyer, 2012 #292"); [Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). Compounding this problem, retention of young employees remains relatively low as they tend to leave jobs faster than older workers do ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287")). These factors drive a “war for talent” as firms struggle to effectively hire quality candidates and develop critical retention strategies for these young workers ([Nolan, 2015](#_enref_69 "Nolan, 2015 #439"); [Runde, 2016](#_enref_80 "Runde, 2016 #444")). Organizations can thus use the results herein to refine their brand as employers of choice on campus. They can also apply the results to reduce conflict between generational cohorts in the workplace, thereby improving workplace collegiality, job satisfaction, and talent retention ([Perry, Hanvongse, & Casoinic, 2013](#_enref_73 "Perry, 2013 #440")).

We start below with a review of generational theory, then a summary of extant work values literature and subsequent research questions that address gaps in this literature. We next review the methodology, including survey development and administration. We then overview the results of students’ desired work values and subsequent gaps of faculty and career services understanding of these values. We close with opportunities for faculty, academic programs, and career services to overcome these gaps.

1. **Literature Review**

Mannheim ([1952](#_enref_62 "Mannheim, 1952 #387")) originally established a theory of generations based on the idea that people within a generational group (cohort) are bonded by experiences and events related to such factors as wars, politics, technology, work, globalization, and family ([Becton, Walker, & Jones-Farmer, 2014](#_enref_4 "Becton, 2014 #295"); [Kuron, Lyons, Schweitzer, & Ng, 2015](#_enref_49 "Kuron, 2015 #298"); [Macky, Gardner, & Forsyth, 2008](#_enref_58 "Macky, 2008 #69")). That is, people of similar ages are shaped by historical events and experiences, thus giving rise to social cohorts that share similar values. Such generations are usually defined as being around 17-20 years in length, roughly the time is takes to map cultural changes ([Howe & Strauss, 1991](#_enref_36 "Howe, 1991 #512")). Table 1 summarizes the generations that make up a majority of the existing professional workforce and current college students. In our business classrooms for instance, we have seen a recent transition from Gen Y (also known as Millennials) to Gen Z.

Table 1: Generational Cohort

|**Cohort**|**Birth Years**|**U.S. Population**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Baby Boomers (Boomers)|1946-1964|74 million|
|Generation X (Gen X)|1965-1979|66 million|
|Generation Y (Gen Y, Millennials)|1980-1994|80 million|
|Generation Z (Gen Z, Post-Millennials, iGen)|1995-2012|74 million|


There is some discord about differences among generations. While a few scholars argue against significant generational effects ([Costanza, Badger, Fraser, Severt, & Gade, 2012](#_enref_15 "Costanza, 2012 #71"); [Costanza & Finkelstein, 2015](#_enref_16 "Costanza, 2015 #300")), a larger group establishes small yet meaningful generational impacts ([Kowske, Rasch, & Wiley, 2010](#_enref_47 "Kowske, 2010 #272"); [Macky, et al., 2008](#_enref_58 "Macky, 2008 #69")). Further complicating generational differences, some scholars highlight significant variation within generations, purporting that analyses across a generational cohort mask within group variation (Lyons & Kuron, 2014). In that respect, generational shifts are not distinct and abrupt. Rather they occur in a steady, linear fashion over time ([Campbell, Campbell, Siedor, & Twenge, 2015](#_enref_9 "Campbell, 2015 #302"); [Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). Yet, scholars note that such small changes ultimately create large scale misunderstanding and tension between generations ([Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). 

For the work herein, we follow the scholarly majority that maintains small yet meaningful differences across generations exist, therefore emphasizing the importance of studying the current college generation ([Lyons & Kuron, 2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268"); [Lyons, Urick, et al., 2015](#_enref_57 "Lyons, 2015 #294")). “There are sufficient research studies that point to meaningful and material differences across the four generations with respect to their work values, attitudes, and career expectations” ([Ng & Parry, 2016, p. 26](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). Without continued empirical study, generations are therefore subject to misperception and subsequent stereotyping.

***2.1	Work Values and Career Fit***

Such misunderstanding of generational differences can manifest as intergenerational conflict in the workplace via perceived differences, accurately or inaccurately, in work values ([Urick, et al., 2017](#_enref_101 "Urick, 2017 #306")). These work values, which represent an individual’s beliefs and ideas related to their occupation or job, represent rewards that the individual desires from work ([Dose, 1997](#_enref_22 "Dose, 1997 #140")). For example, intrinsic work values relate to the actual tasks and fulfillment of doing the job, including helping others or doing challenging work. Extrinsic work values on the other hand, are concerned with what one gets out of their work (rather than what they put in) and include compensation, recognition and job security. 

Career theory emphasizes the importance of the fit of these values between the individual and their work environment ([Ballout, 2007](#_enref_1 "Ballout, 2007 #397"); [Su, Murdock, & Rounds, 2015](#_enref_89 "Su, 2015 #446")). Such person-environment (P-E) fit can include multiple dimensions, including person-organization fit, person-supervisor fit, person-job fit, and the relatively understudied person-vocation fit on which we focus herein ([Vogel & Feldman, 2009](#_enref_103 "Vogel, 2009 #398")). From a P-E fit perspective, a mismatch of an individual’s work values to the environment leads to dissatisfaction and turnover, a problem particularly endemic to the current younger generations ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287"); [Su, et al., 2015](#_enref_89 "Su, 2015 #446")). 

Underlying P-E fit is a psychological contract between employer and employee as a set of unwritten expectations of what each provides the other ([Rousseau, 1995](#_enref_79 "Rousseau, 1995 #399")). Violations of these reciprocal obligations can be detrimental to the employment relationship as a lack of fit. For the research herein, this fit extends to academia as a student develops such contracts with faculty when selecting specific classes, with academic programs when selecting a major, and with career services when job seeking ([Koskina, 2013](#_enref_46 "Koskina, 2013 #400")).

Faculty, academic administrators, and career services must acknowledge our role in forming and realizing these psychological contracts. Specifically, we must present complete, accurate, and compelling portraits of courses, majors, and careers to not just attract students but also help them to develop realistic and achievable psychological contracts ([Larson, 2018](#_enref_50 "Larson, 2018 #511")). Therefore, our duty as experienced, informed business educators and professionals is to ensure the best fit between the students and these courses, majors, and ultimately careers ([Milsom & Coughlin, 2015](#_enref_63 "Milsom, 2015 #438")). Such compatibility remains paramount not only to the students but also to their future employers since a weak fit means that the students will later experience lower satisfaction, lower productivity, and higher turnover in their careers. Such undesirable outcomes challenge the legitimacy of our academic institutions.

Researchers indicate that work values are more influenced by generation than age and maturation ([Smola & Sutton, 2002](#_enref_88 "Smola, 2002 #77")). As such, the specifics of these educational psychological contracts will change with new generations ([Cennamo & Gardner, 2008](#_enref_11 "Cennamo, 2008 #74")). As such, professors, academic leaders, and career services must stay keenly and promptly attuned to shifts in student expectations. Just as human resource policies in the workplace have been set by the Boomer and Gen X generations ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")), academic courses, majors, and textbooks have been primarily developed by the same older cohorts. Understanding the changing expectations of the younger college generation can help us to better connect with and serve younger students. 

***2.2	Gen Y Work Values***

Research investigation into the work values and expectations of the Gen Z cohort is a recent phenomenon. Early studies focused on defining this generation in a variety of ways from their relative historical position in society ([Howe & Strauss, 1991](#_enref_36 "Howe, 1991 #512")) to very specific aspects and descriptions of this group, such as their tech-fluent abilities ([Palley, 2012](#_enref_71 "Palley, 2012 #526"); [Turner, 2015](#_enref_94 "Turner, 2015 #529")), social media connections ([Turner, 2015](#_enref_94 "Turner, 2015 #529")), retail spending habits ([Deep Focus, 2015](#_enref_19 "Deep Focus, 2-15 #525")) and focus on entrepreneurial/self-reliant interests ([Beall, 2017](#_enref_3 "Beall, 2017 #524"); [Deep Focus, 2-15](#_enref_19 "Deep Focus, 2-15 #525"); [The Center for Generational Kinetics - CGK, 2016](#_enref_93 "The Center for Generational Kinetics - CGK, 2016 #528")). More recent efforts have addressed research objectives involving Gen Z work expectations and values including the future needs of employers. Gen Z individuals expect that when they enter the workforce, they’ll have face time with their boss, will have flexible career paths, will want to simultaneously explore many different industries and roles, and will expect competitive salaries ([Tysiac, 2017](#_enref_100 "Tysiac, 2017 #530")). Schwieger and Ladwig ([2018](#_enref_84 "Schwieger, 2018 #527")) describe Gen Z characteristics and work expectations as well as top skills desired by potential employers through a summary of existing research. They reported that Gen Z individuals value hard work and want to be rewarded for it, are ambitious and self-starting, and are motivated to plan for their future ([Schwieger & Ladwig, 2018](#_enref_84 "Schwieger, 2018 #527")). Employers value skills such as the ability to work in a team, problem solving, communication and a strong work ethic ([Schwieger & Ladwig, 2018](#_enref_84 "Schwieger, 2018 #527")). They further propose an input-output model for Gen Z skills development that could potentially enhance existing educational programs by including pedagogical aspects such as minors and concentrations, experiential learning opportunities, blended courses, competitive events and professional certification programs.

Such research on Gen Z is still relatively limited, and additional research is continually needed to understand this young cohort as they develop at university and into their careers. We therefore build on prior research by conducting a detailed empirical investigation into Gen Z business student work values as well as the perceptions of university faculty and career advisement professionals about these values. In this study, we follow well-cited extant literature to focus on seven work values (Table 2): **extrinsic**, **intrinsic**, **social**, **altruistic**, **leisure, supervisory**, and **job stability** ([Maloni, Campbell, Gligor, Scherrer, & Boyd, 2017](#_enref_59 "Maloni, 2017 #331"); [Twenge, Campbell, & Freeman, 2012](#_enref_98 "Twenge, 2012 #8")). While several studies have assessed work value differences among Boomers, Gen X, and Gen Y ([Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")), there is limited empirical evidence of the work values of Gen Z, who now comprise a majority of our college students. Therefore, we next review work values of Gen Y as a precursor to our focus herein on Gen Z business students. As scholars validate steady yet linear shifts of work values between generations, the foundations established in Gen Y literature sets the stage for the Gen Z work values survey below ([Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")).

Gen Y work values can be explained in part by their upbringing. Specifically, Gen Y was typically raised with significant and constant parent involvement and feedback ([Hurst & Good, 2009](#_enref_38 "Hurst, 2009 #9"); [Luscombe, et al., 2013](#_enref_53 "Luscombe, 2013 #17"); [Terjesen, et al., 2007](#_enref_92 "Terjesen, 2007 #12")). Gen Y was also often rewarded more so for participation than achievement ([Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311")). Subsequently, their individualistic traits are high. Likewise, they are assertive, have high expectations, and retain high levels of self-esteem ([Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311"); [Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). On the other hand, their upbringing also causes them to be perceived as entitled and narcissistic ([Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311")). Moreover, they are risk adverse ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287")). Finally, they retain lower need for social approval, yet also require significant praise ([Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")).

With these characteristics, **extrinsic** work values, such as compensation, benefits, and status, tend to be important for Gen Y ([Leuty & Hansen, 2011](#_enref_51 "Leuty, 2011 #297"); [Lyons & Kuron, 2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268"); [Twenge, et al., 2010](#_enref_97 "Twenge, 2010 #67")). Gen Y also focuses heavily on advancement opportunities, including a clear path to succeed in the organization ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14"); [Wong, Gardiner, Lang, & Coulon, 2008](#_enref_106 "Wong, 2008 #75")). As De Hauw and De Vos ([2010, p. 293](#_enref_17 "De Hauw, 2010 #15")) submit, career development and financial rewards are “embedded within the generation.” This career development focus syncs with the learning and skills aspects of **intrinsic** values that are also very important to Gen Y ([Hansen & Leuty, 2012](#_enref_30 "Hansen, 2012 #309"); [Kuron, et al., 2015](#_enref_49 "Kuron, 2015 #298")). Gen Y has a strong belief that education leads to future success as intrinsic skills enable extrinsic outcomes ([Kilber, Barclay, & Ohmer, 2014](#_enref_42 "Kilber, 2014 #435")). 

`	`Next, Gen Y tends to expect significant **supervisory** guidance, feedback, and support, which evolves from the aforementioned parent-involved upbringing ([Hurst & Good, 2009](#_enref_38 "Hurst, 2009 #9"); [Luscombe, et al., 2013](#_enref_53 "Luscombe, 2013 #17"); [Terjesen, et al., 2007](#_enref_92 "Terjesen, 2007 #12")). This can include frequent, detailed instructions for tasks. Continuing, Twenge ([2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")) contends that **social** work values for Gen Y are unclear. Some research maintains that the social aspect of work, including co-worker support, is important ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287"); [Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14")). However, other research indicates that the importance of social values is decreasing as the younger generation remains content with their established social networks outside of work ([Twenge, et al., 2010](#_enref_97 "Twenge, 2010 #67")). 

`	`The importance of **altruistic** work values tends to be misunderstood for Gen Y. While popular press portrays Gen Y as highly socially conscious, empirical results indicate that factors such as altruism, philanthropy, and environmental conservation are rather low, reflecting an individualistic, win-at-all-costs Gen Y mindset ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312"); [Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68"); [Twenge, et al., 2012](#_enref_98 "Twenge, 2012 #8")). However, **leisure** remains important for Gen Y as they consider work to be less central to their lives than older generations ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312"); [Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")). So, work-life balance represents a focus as Gen Y seeks flexibility (e.g., flex time) and freedom, especially to avoid extreme work hours and irregular schedules ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287"); [Cennamo & Gardner, 2008](#_enref_11 "Cennamo, 2008 #74")). Finally, Gen Y has a moderate focus on **stability** as they value job security, which fits with their aversion to risk ([Guillot-Soulez & Soulez, 2014](#_enref_29 "Guillot-Soulez, 2014 #4")). However, Lyons and Kuron ([2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268")) declare that job security is decreasing with the younger generation.

***2.3	Gen Z Business Students***

The work values above reflect a typical Gen Y member but not necessarily our current Gen Z business students. Generational theory indicates that such work values are changing with the onset on Gen Z, which has been relatively unstudied to date. Moreover, scholars stress the importance of appreciating heterogeneity within generations, challenging researchers to study specific segments within each generation ([Guillot-Soulez & Soulez, 2014](#_enref_29 "Guillot-Soulez, 2014 #4"); [Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311"); [Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). For example, business students have particular preferences that do not correspond in some cases with the reported stereotypes or characteristics of their cohort ([Barnes & Jacobsen, 2015](#_enref_2 "Barnes, 2015 #430")). However, work values literature has yet to thoroughly evaluate students specifically in business schools. A gap therefore emerges in the need for a contemporary and more transparent picture of business students’ expected work values:

RQ1: What are the expected career work values of current undergraduate business students?

Existing research also suggests that faculty and career services remain relatively out-of-touch with student work values ([W. A. Weeks, Rutherford, Boles, & Loe, 2014](#_enref_105 "Weeks, 2014 #291")). As a result, faculty may be ineffective in engaging with the new generation of business students to motivate them in the classroom. Similarly, academic programs and career services may be ineffective in promoting academic majors as well as ensuring a strong fit of student expectations with these majors and subsequent best-fit careers. An additional gap therefore emerges in our ability to respond to students work values in the classroom and in the career development process, yielding two associated research questions:

RQ2: How accurately do business faculty and career services understand these students’ work values?

RQ3: How can business faculty, academic programs, and career services respond to gaps in our understanding of these work values to better connect with students in the classroom and ensure best-fit careers?

We address RQ1 below with a survey of the desired work values of current Gen Z students at seven universities in the southeast United States, comparing these values to Gen Y. We then assess RQ2 via surveys of faculty and career services to measure our understanding of the student work values. Finally, we address RQ3 by drawing from existing generational literature to provide specific recommendations to professors, academic programs, and career services to more effectively connect with the current generation of business students. 

1. **Student Survey**

In assessing RQ1, we explored an initial comprehensive set of 44 survey scales collected from existing literature to measure the seven work values (Table 2). Students were asked to assess each item with: “*Thinking ahead to after college graduation, how important is each item below for your ideal job*” with the response scale ranging from *1–not important* to *5–essential*. We distributed these items in a pilot survey to 409 undergraduate business students. An exploratory factor analysis of the data isolated the 22 most significant items attached to the seven values (Appendix A). The discarded items either did not significantly and unidimensionally load on one of the given factors or demonstrated excessive collinearity with another scale. The 22 items therefore offer a thorough yet parsimonious measurement of the seven work values.

`	`We distributed the final version of the 22-item survey via Qualtrics, an on-line survey tool. To capture sufficient quantities of Gen Z and Gen Y members, we collected data at two different time periods that were three years apart. In all, we distributed the survey to a total of 7,860 business students at seven different universities in one state in the southeastern United States. Students were contacted via e-mail, asking them to follow a link to the survey, and two e-mail reminders were later sent about a week apart. 1,753 students ultimately provided full, usable responses (22.3% response rate). We used the Welch test to verify that the responses from Gen Y students were similar across the two time periods as was the Gen Z student responses across the two time periods ([Ruxton, 2006](#_enref_81 "Ruxton, 2006 #516")). Table 3 provides an overview of respondent demographics.

***3.1	Student Results***

Table 4 summarizes the student survey results, focusing on Gen Z differences from Gen Y. The Welch test was used to account for unequal variances and unequal sample sizes ([Ruxton, 2006](#_enref_81 "Ruxton, 2006 #516")). The results show broad similarities between the Gen Z and Gen Y generations, yet also highlight some meaningful shifts. Gen Z students’ most desired value is the ability to see the results of their work (IN7), reflecting their interest in meaningful work and making an impact. This value ranks second with Gen Y students. Other intrinsic values, including learning (IN5), skill sets (IN6), and creativity (IN8), are also moderately highly ranked. The importance of these intrinsic factors are generally stronger than found in existing literature ([Twenge, et al., 2010](#_enref_97 "Twenge, 2010 #67")). Yet, Gen Z’s focus on learning (IN5) was significantly lower than that of Gen Y.

*Notes: \*statistically significant difference from Gen Z mean at p<.0.05, \*\* p< 0.01,* 

*\*\*\* p<0.001 from two-population t-tests.*

Opportunity for advancement and promotion (EX2) ranks second with Gen Z and first with Gen Y, which does align with existing literature ([Hansen & Leuty, 2012](#_enref_30 "Hansen, 2012 #309"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14")). However, Gen Z’s emphasis on promotion was significantly less than that of Gen Y. Money (EX1) is also highly ranked with both Gen Z and Gen Y students, which aligns with the existing literature that emphasizes the importance of salary with current younger generations. However, the lower relative importance of status (EX3) and respect (EX4) contradicts the literature ([Cennamo & Gardner, 2008](#_enref_11 "Cennamo, 2008 #74"); [Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312"); [Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")). 

Gen Z business students also seek a stable future, including security (ST22), good retirement (ST7), and healthcare benefits (ST21). While existing literature recognizes Gen Y’s limited risk taking nature ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287")), the relative strength of these items is noteworthy compared to previous results ([Guillot-Soulez & Soulez, 2014](#_enref_29 "Guillot-Soulez, 2014 #4"); [Lyons & Kuron, 2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268")). Next, supervision (SU9, SU10, SU11) represents the third relatively most important set of values, which does align with existing literature ([Hurst & Good, 2009](#_enref_38 "Hurst, 2009 #9"); [Luscombe, et al., 2013](#_enref_53 "Luscombe, 2013 #17"); [Terjesen, et al., 2007](#_enref_92 "Terjesen, 2007 #12")).

`	`Continuing, social factors, including making friends (SO12), contact with people (SO13), and common interests with co-workers (SO14), represent relatively less important work values, providing some clarification over inconsistent findings from past literature ([Campione, 2015](#_enref_10 "Campione, 2015 #287"); [Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14"); [Twenge, et al., 2010](#_enref_97 "Twenge, 2010 #67")). However, the results depict a significantly higher emphasis on all three social items by Gen Z compared to Gen Y, suggesting a possible shift in importance. Additionally, leisure values, including pace of work (LE19) and more than two weeks of vacation (LE17), are also of less importance. Time for activities outside of work (LE18) retains moderate importance, reflecting literature supporting the decreased focus on work of younger generations ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312"); [Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")). 

Overall, these results paint an interesting and specific picture of current business students. Clearly, these students are highly focused on stability (ST20, ST21, ST22). However, extant literature indicates that such stability centers more so on the career rather than a single consistent employer ([Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311")). In part, the students have seen a general lack of loyalty to long time employees (e.g., their parents) and accordingly have low expectations for job security from any one company ([Kowske, et al., 2010](#_enref_47 "Kowske, 2010 #272")). So, they seek a flexible, non-linear, job-hopping career wherein lateral and downward moves are acceptable for the objectives of faster advancement and overall career success ([Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311")). Advancement (EX2) and money (EX5) created by the mobility via the acquired skill sets (IN5, IN6, IN7, IN8) and experience empower their desired stability ([Lyons, Schweitzer, & Ng, 2015](#_enref_56 "Lyons, 2015 #290")).

1. **Faculty and Career Services Survey**

With the work values of Gen Z business students (RQ1) established above in section 3, we address RQ2 with **faculty and career services perspectives** of students’ work values using the same survey items from the student survey. The wording for the faculty survey read: “*For the next questions, use your teaching experience to consider a typical undergraduate student in your class between 18 and 22 years old with a B (3.00) grade point average. Evaluate their perspective of the importance of each item to their ideal job after college graduation. My typical student wants a job* ...” We verified the appropriateness and clarity of this wording with seven faculty who were not part of the project. The work values were worded the same as the student survey, using the same response scale that ranged from *1–not important* to *5–essential.* The survey was distributed to 926 business faculty members at the same seven universities as the student population, yielding 225 responses (24.3% response rate). Table 5 summarizes faculty demographics.

The career services survey read: “*Using your experience, consider a typical college undergraduate business major who is exploring careers and jobs. Evaluate their perspective of the importance of each item to their ideal job after college graduation. A typical business student wants a job ...*” We verified the appropriateness and clarity of this wording with four career service personnel who were not part of the project. Again, the work values were worded the same as the student survey, using the same response scale from *1–not important* to *5–essential.* The distribution list was obtained from a professional career services organization based in the same state as the surveyed schools. The organization focuses on career services for college students and includes university career service personnel as well as recruiters and consultants. The survey was distributed to 244 members with 69 providing usable responses (28.3% response rate). Table 6 summarizes their demographics.

***4.1	Comparison to Actual Student Expectations***

Table 7 presents the results of the faculty and career services interpretations of Gen Z business students’ expected work values, including both correlations and comparison of means (two-population t-tests again using the Welch test). The correlation results denote that faculty and career services are somewhat in touch with the *relative importance* of student work values. In other words, we are directionally correct in the rank order of the values. Comparison of means also shows that faculty and career services are generally accurate with the importance of most extrinsic values with the exception of promotion (EX2) for faculty. Additionally, while faculty seem to understand the relative importance of leisure values, career services personnel underestimate the importance of vacation (LE17) and a slow pace (LE19).

In an overall sense however, faculty and career services significantly *underestimate* the importance of most student work values. Most notably, we grossly underestimate intrinsic, supervisory, social, altruistic, and stability values. For instance, we undervalue our students’ interest in intrinsic skills like learning (IN6) and creativity (IN8), which challenges us to find ways to better stimulate these important skill sets in the classroom and emphasize them in majors and career paths. We also misjudge students’ expectations for supervisory involvement (SU9, SU10, SU11), implying that we may underserve their desire for consistent personal evaluation and feedback in class and during the career search process. Moreover, we may inaccurately mistake the younger generation’s tendency to frequently switch jobs as a disregard for overall career security (ST20, ST21, ST22), when such security is in fact among the most important set of values for them. 

1. **Discussion**

The above results reveal that faculty and career services remain relatively out of touch with the significance of a majority of the career work values considered most important by current business students. This misunderstanding may arise from faculty and career services lacking formal tools and efforts to fully understand student expectations. Instead, we may rely on expectations communicated by employers, such as via surveys from industry professional associations. We also may default to our own perceptions of expectations formed from our professional experiences. Moreover, students lacking significant work experience (compared to faculty and career services) may cause us to devalue student expectations as unrealistic, impractical, and naïve. 

As such, the underlying assumption held by faculty and career services may be that students must adapt to the realities of the professional workplace with our deep teaching and professional experience helping them to prepare them for this shift. However, generational theory maintains that the younger generation’s expectations also signal valid shifts in the workplace of the future. As an example of constructive progression in education, students now favor classroom environments with more experiential learning opportunities such as site visits, applied company projects, and mentor engagements ([Larson, 2018](#_enref_50 "Larson, 2018 #511")). Universities can thus play a key role in helping employers to appreciate the issues and opportunities that these student expectations pose to the future workplace as Gen Z continues to fill a larger portion of the workforce.

Moreover, the younger generation is not necessarily eager to change to meet all expectations of older generations ([K. P. Weeks & Schaffert, forthcoming](#_enref_104 "Weeks, forthcoming #449")). In fact, the younger generations attributes their workplace struggles in part to an unfair and inequitable “two-tiered system” favoring older generations (Ng & Parry 2016). We can therefore improve our efforts to adjust our courses, academic programs, and career placement initiatives to more effectively connect with students’ expectations. Such changes not only benefit the students in their interest and motivation in the classroom, major, and career search but also likely increase the satisfaction that we find in our role as educators and career counselors ([Romsa, Bremer, & Lewis, 2017](#_enref_78 "Romsa, 2017 #442")). 

With this mindset, we next draw upon existing generational career literature to suggest ways for faculty, academic programs, and career services to better connect with students. These ideas are not necessarily possible for all schools given available resources, class sizes, research and service expectations, and other factors. Still, the discussion poses preliminary thoughts of potential best practices for connecting with the young generation of business students.

***5.1	Faculty***

While we as faculty may be centered primarily on course content, the results suggest that students may be more so focused on how this content will make them valuable and mobile in the workplace ([Kumar & Bhandarker, 2017](#_enref_48 "Kumar, 2017 #437"); [Pfeffer & Fong, 2004](#_enref_74 "Pfeffer, 2004 #386")). In other words, the students translate course content to career-progression skills such as self-regulated and independent learning as well as critical analysis and thinking ([Mynott, 2018](#_enref_64 "Mynott, 2018 #510"); [Örtenblad, Koris, & Farquharson, 2013](#_enref_70 "Örtenblad, 2013 #515")). Students will likely be more open to faculty direction and consider coursework to be more legitimate if they trust that the underlying motivations extend beyond the course to eventual career success. Classroom learning obviously remains critical, but faculty can also more effectively weave career development ideas into courses. For instance, the use of faculty-initiated student personal development plans to encourage a proactive approach to career management can have a positive effect on both student learning and the job search process. ([Hunt, Langowitz, Rollag, & Hebert-Maccaro, 2017](#_enref_37 "Hunt, 2017 #513")). 

Faculty can also proactively emphasize how projects and assignments in the course relate to critical workplace skills, career progression, and security ([Lyons, Schweitzer, et al., 2015](#_enref_56 "Lyons, 2015 #290"); [Phillips & Trainor, 2014](#_enref_75 "Phillips, 2014 #441")). To further relate courses to contemporary skills, faculty can use recent news events to show practical application of course content. Additionally, guest speakers from industry can present applied links between course content and career skills, specifically demonstrating how these skills have enabled their own career progression.

To further enhance valuable workplace skill sets as well as meet the generation’s individualistic expectations, faculty can consider offering a variety of assignments and tasks that challenge students for autonomy, personal development, and independent thinking ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14")). Scholars also point to the importance of active learning with activity-based knowledge acquisition through technology (e.g. simulations) ([Farrell & Hurt, 2014](#_enref_24 "Farrell, 2014 #308")). Moreover, faculty can give students responsibility and flexibility to formulate assignments in their own way, even allowing them to shape expectations and outcomes ([Kim, Knight, & Crutsinger, 2009](#_enref_43 "Kim, 2009 #19"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14")). Extending this idea, professors can offer further autonomy and flexibility with collaboratively-developed syllabi ([Fornaciari & Dean, 2014](#_enref_25 "Fornaciari, 2014 #405")). Examples might include creative attendance policies and allowing some grades to be dropped. While the workload associated with such initiatives may seem onerous to faculty, such practices are better in representing future workplace experiences.

The students’ high expectations for guidance and feedback however pose a challenge to this approach. Constant and immediate feedback to individual students is generally expected even as students may still not take accountability for their own development ([Farrell & Hurt, 2014](#_enref_24 "Farrell, 2014 #308"); [Shaw & Fairhurst, 2008](#_enref_87 "Shaw, 2008 #13")). Fitting with the Gen Z’s individualistic focus, faculty in smaller classes can meet with students one-on-one to plan assignments and course expectations then continue to meet to review progress ([Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). We can also invite students for individualized sessions to discuss personalized career opportunities ([Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70"); [Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). In fact, faculty may set such meetings as a mandatory part of the course where class sizes permit. Such direct mentoring has additional benefits of enriching student motivation and subsequent course success ([Hurst & Good, 2009](#_enref_38 "Hurst, 2009 #9")). In larger classes, faculty could utilize learning communities among students and design assignments for personalized feedback and guidance from peers.

Furthermore, extant literature points to the importance of establishing our leadership and authority in the classroom as critical to connecting with younger students ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). The younger generation tends to stereotype older generations (i.e., many of their professors) as inflexible and difficult to engage, thereby instilling latent tension in the classroom ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). As the younger generation is not necessarily willing to adapt to older generations, students may thus undervalue our professional credibility and competence, feeling that our leadership authority must still be earned ([Lyons & Kuron, 2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268"); [Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). Research points to important traits for overcoming generational tensions to enable a professor-led collegial classroom environment. For instance, students more so value relationship-focused traits such dependability, support, and trust, which can be fostered by more personal, individual interaction ([Lyons & Kuron, 2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268")). Authenticity is also important, as are clarity and relevancy ([Goldman, Cranmer, Sollitto, Labelle, & Lancaster, 2017](#_enref_28 "Goldman, 2017 #434"); [Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). 

***5.2	Academic Programs***

Academic programs (e.g., departments, centers) can capitalize on the results to better market majors and minors to students as well as ensure a better fit of students to these programs ([Hiatt, Swaim, & Maloni, 2018](#_enref_34 "Hiatt, 2018 #517")). Perhaps more importantly, we can use the results to refine the student experience. Focused on stable yet boundaryless careers and yearning for personal career development opportunities ([Broadbridge, Maxwell, & Ogden, 2009](#_enref_7 "Broadbridge, 2009 #11"); [Deloitte, 2016](#_enref_20 "Deloitte, 2016 #433"); [Ng & Johnson, 2015](#_enref_66 "Ng, 2015 #311")), students seek an educational experience that offers relevant skill sets and a dynamic, forward-looking career-initiating solution that cares for them as individuals ([Terjesen, et al., 2007](#_enref_92 "Terjesen, 2007 #12"); [Twenge, 2010](#_enref_95 "Twenge, 2010 #70")). However, students do not feel that business schools are able to effectively deliver this experience ([Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310"); [Pfeffer & Fong, 2004](#_enref_74 "Pfeffer, 2004 #386")). 

`	`While some business schools have developed their own specialized (versus university-wide) career service resources ([Engelland, Workman, & Singh, 2000](#_enref_23 "Engelland, 2000 #471")), academic programs can benefit from further specialization of career counseling, including partnerships with career service experts. In this respect, programs could ideally offer one-on-one advising that synchronizes academic and career counseling to customize student career expectations and career maps ([Kowske, et al., 2010](#_enref_47 "Kowske, 2010 #272"); [Twenge & Campbell, 2008](#_enref_96 "Twenge, 2008 #68")). The ultimate goal would include affirmation of each student’s vocational identity ([Holland, et al., 1993](#_enref_35 "Holland, 1993 #481"); [Scott & Ciani, 2008](#_enref_85 "Scott, 2008 #474")). This process could include regular progress reviews. In doing so, advisors can promote the mobility and security of career paths related to the major ([Lyons, Schweitzer, et al., 2015](#_enref_56 "Lyons, 2015 #290")). This approach supports the students’ desire for mentoring and training beyond classroom content ([Hurst & Good, 2009](#_enref_38 "Hurst, 2009 #9")). Programs can also market potential career success and stability by promoting its rankings among other programs as well as by profiling successful alumni. 

Moreover, academic programs can create opportunities for students to network (in-person and on-line) with working professionals, which can also support development of important networking skills. These professionals can present their own career progression paths and when possible, meet with students for one-on-one career pathing and mentoring. Furthermore, it is important for academic programs to develop extensive internship/co-op programs, even making participation a requirement and attaching assignments to ensure student learning ([Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310")). Such experience can further help students with career mapping and possibly shape some work expectations to the realities of the professional workplace. Academic programs can also support student clubs specific to certain majors and skill sets (e.g., auditing, sales, project management, etc.), synchronizing with professional organizations where possible to encourage interaction of students with practitioners. For instance, recent business school experiential pedagogy has proposed development of reciprocal learning relationships between faculty members, students, and business professionals ([Tyran & Garcia, 2015](#_enref_99 "Tyran, 2015 #448")).

`	`Finally, generational literature reveals the importance of marketing media ([Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310"); [Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312")). When exploring majors and career opportunities for instance, business students rely more heavily on family, business professionals, and internet research than they do on the school, professors, and other students ([Maloni, Scherrer, Campbell, & Boyd, 2016](#_enref_60 "Maloni, 2016 #257")). Additionally, social media outperforms printed materials, like that typically offered by departments and advising centers ([Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310")). Students also value information sessions with professional speakers, especially those allowing one-on-one networking ([Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310")). Academic programs can thus work with marketing professionals and career counselors, both inside and outside the business school and university, to develop a contemporary, multi-faceted media presence for students and other key influencers such as parents. 

***5.3	Career Services***

In a similar vein to academic programs, career service personnel can use the results of this study to improve their ability to serve students. For business students, the job search represents a culmination of their time, financial, and emotional investment in college. Accordingly, universities now better understand the importance of career services for long-term student benefit and satisfaction ([Dey & Cruzvergara, 2014](#_enref_21 "Dey, 2014 #479")). Yet, students have low expectations of university career centers ([Ng & Burke, 2006](#_enref_65 "Ng, 2006 #310"); [Pfeffer & Fong, 2004](#_enref_74 "Pfeffer, 2004 #386")). Despite the significant stress of the career selection process, many students subsequently do not use career services due such low expectations as well as a lack of awareness of services offered and underlying stigmas associated with seeking career help ([Fouad, et al., 2006](#_enref_26 "Fouad, 2006 #475"); [Ludwikowski, Vogel, & Armstrong, 2009](#_enref_52 "Ludwikowski, 2009 #478")). 

Inaccurate assumptions of student career expectations may compound such challenges. Consequently, the results herein can enhance the effectiveness of career services in connecting with students. Specifically, existing literature presents career development processes that begin with individual understanding of students’ personal values and skills ([Sampson, Peterson, & et al., 1992](#_enref_82 "Sampson, 1992 #473"); [Taylor & Betz, 1983](#_enref_91 "Taylor, 1983 #480")). Career services then can work with the students to explore the characteristics of different career options, helping them to align their values and skills to these potential careers while also encouraging a sense of ownership with their future careers ([Hunt, et al., 2017](#_enref_37 "Hunt, 2017 #513"); [Larson, 2018](#_enref_50 "Larson, 2018 #511")). Therefore, the results herein can increase career service awareness of student values during this process to improve the student-career fit. 

As discussed previously, the younger generation has been meticulously guided by parents, so individual student counseling remains paramount for career services ([Rayman, 1999](#_enref_77 "Rayman, 1999 #472")). Scholars indeed highlight contemporary career services centered on customized counseling and collaborative career devleopment ([Dey & Cruzvergara, 2014](#_enref_21 "Dey, 2014 #479"); [Kettunen, Vuorinen, & Sampson, 2015](#_enref_41 "Kettunen, 2015 #467")). Yet, scholars also promote the use of technology and social media beyond one-on-one counseling to support virtual communities of co-counseling where participants interact to help one another ([Harris-Bowlsbey & Sampson, 2005](#_enref_31 "Harris-Bowlsbey, 2005 #469"); [Kettunen, et al., 2015](#_enref_41 "Kettunen, 2015 #467"); [Venable, 2010](#_enref_102 "Venable, 2010 #477")). These participants can include not only students and career services but also employers, consultants, and alumni ([Rayman, 1999](#_enref_77 "Rayman, 1999 #472")). Again, the results herein support a more informed discussion of work values within these communites to encourage student fit with careers as well as to coach students in their transition to the professional workplace ([Rayman, 1999](#_enref_77 "Rayman, 1999 #472")). Moreover, these communites can improve student career adaptability when their personal values later do not match those of their employer or chosen field ([Koen, et al., 2012](#_enref_45 "Koen, 2012 #476")).

The results can also help career services work with employers to enhance the employer’s organizational “brand” on campus. Specifically, existing literature promotes the importance of a brand in becoming an employer of choice among students ([Dey & Cruzvergara, 2014](#_enref_21 "Dey, 2014 #479")). Employers can engage career services and the entire campus community to assess how their brand aligns with student career values. Employers can then explore adjustments within their organizations to adapt to student expectations, especially as these expectations change over time within and between generations. Further, career services can work with the employers to develop effective on-campus activities with students to remarket the employer brand.

1. **Conclusion**

It is during their college years that young people start to actively gather information about their future career directions. As Gen Z continues to emerge into the professional workforce, we cannot assume that past workplace and educational practices are best for the new workforce ([Cilliers, 2017](#_enref_13 "Cilliers, 2017 #432"); [Lyons & Kuron, 2014](#_enref_55 "Lyons, 2014 #268"); [Ng, et al., 2010](#_enref_68 "Ng, 2010 #14"); [Seemiller & Grace, 2017](#_enref_86 "Seemiller, 2017 #445")). To address this opportunity, our research empirically validates the desired work values of current undergraduate business students (RQ1), depicting subtle yet important shifts from values established in existing generational literature. The results also reveal that faculty and career services are not fully aware of these work values (RQ2). 

The point here is not to criticize faculty and career services. Every older generation has in some way been confounded by younger generations. Rather, the main point is to emphasize the importance of studying our current business students to identify generational differences while exploring ways to reduce any resulting intergenerational misunderstandings and tensions. Hence, we drew upon existing generational literature to offer insights for faculty, academic programs, and career services to better connect with students (RQ3). 

In doing so, we offer several contributions. First, better understanding of student expectations enables faculty to boost student interest and enthusiasm in the classroom, thereby likely increasing their productivity and satisfaction in our courses. Next, academic programs can use the findings to better design and promote majors to meet student expectations as well as address professional workforce shortages ([Maloni, Scherrer, & Mascaritolo, 2016](#_enref_61 "Maloni, 2016 #258"); [W. A. Weeks, et al., 2014](#_enref_105 "Weeks, 2014 #291")). Relatedly, career services can use the results to more effectively coach students through career exploration as well as work with employers to improve their campus brand. In doing so, we can all work together to enrich the fit of students to their majors, thereby directing them to more suitable careers and reducing subsequent workplace turnover, a condition that has plagued the younger generation. Moreover, we do not always have to conform to the younger generation. In contrast, the results can also direct us where to help the younger generation adapt their expectations to current workplace realities.

***6.1	Future Research***

Limitations of the study herein offer ideas for future research. While we did collect data from seven southeastern U.S. schools, a glaring concern centers on generalizability to other U.S. and global locations. Hofstede’s culture dimensions contend that values will differ by culture ([Chow, Shields, & Wu, 1999](#_enref_12 "Chow, 1999 #519")). Work values have been assessed across different countries with examples including Canada ([Kuron, et al., 2015](#_enref_49 "Kuron, 2015 #298"); [Lyons, Higgins, & Duxbury, 2010](#_enref_54 "Lyons, 2010 #388")), China ([Ralston, Egri, Stewart, Terpstra, & Kaicheng, 1999](#_enref_76 "Ralston, 1999 #520")), New Zealand ([Cennamo & Gardner, 2008](#_enref_11 "Cennamo, 2008 #74")), and the U.S. ([Twenge, et al., 2010](#_enref_97 "Twenge, 2010 #67")). In a rare multi-national study (U.S, Australian, Singapore, Germany, China), Cogin ([2012](#_enref_14 "Cogin, 2012 #518")) reveals both similarities and differences across cultures. Cross-cultural work value studies therefore remain critical as business students join multi-national companies that work with business partners around the world.

Further analysis could also dive deeper into individual business majors to study the specific expectations of their students. For instance, the career mindset of an accounting major may differ from that of a marketing major, so a more detailed analysis would allow both customization to specific programs and more effective connections with industry expectations. Furthermore, research could follow new graduates into the workplace to comprehend how and under what conditions their work values change with professional experience ([Kuron, et al., 2015](#_enref_49 "Kuron, 2015 #298")). Scholars can also study other career constructs such as vocational maturity, career adaptability, and career decision-making self-efficacy ([Koen, et al., 2012](#_enref_45 "Koen, 2012 #476"); [Sampson, Peterson, Reardon, & Lenz, 2000](#_enref_83 "Sampson, 2000 #470")). Scholars could also evaluate how approaches such as responsible management impact student work values ([Beddewela, Warin, Hesselden, & Coslet, 2017](#_enref_5 "Beddewela, 2017 #514"); [Örtenblad, et al., 2013](#_enref_70 "Örtenblad, 2013 #515")).

Additionally, further study is needed in human resources (HR) management to understand when and how to adapt to generational differences in the workplace. While some literature espouses customizing HR programs and work design to generations ([Hernaus & Vokic, 2014](#_enref_33 "Hernaus, 2014 #305")), other literature cautions against over personalizing HR management relative to generational differences ([Becton, et al., 2014](#_enref_4 "Becton, 2014 #295")). In this perspective, we may also need more dialogue on the market-orientation of the business school. In other words, how can business schools balance education, employer expectations, and student needs to lead the way in crafting the future workplace, rather than merely reacting to stakeholders? Indeed, we are uniquely positioned to both impact students when their values are most malleable ([Jin & Rounds, 2012](#_enref_39 "Jin, 2012 #303"); [Johnson, 2001](#_enref_40 "Johnson, 2001 #142")) and lead collaboration among the stakeholders, all while researching potential best practices derived from theory and industry. For instance, we can lead more research to help employers to first identify work values shifts among younger employees, then develop best practices to attract and retain new employees in order to maximize success opportunities for all employees. As interaction between generations in the workplace remains critical for onboarding new employees, training future leaders, and ensuring knowledge transfer as older generations retire, research can also evaluate best practices in cross-generational mentoring, training, and executive coaching ([Ng & Parry, 2016](#_enref_67 "Ng, 2016 #312"); [Urick, et al., 2017](#_enref_101 "Urick, 2017 #306")).

`	`In conclusion, many research opportunities exist relative to generational differences in business education. We are optimistic that the study has offered compelling insights and inspiration that will allow business schools to support a better understanding of our students. Readers can apply their own expertise, experience, and energy to creatively adapt and extend the recommendations to fit with their teaching environments and then share best practices with colleagues. Doing so will help us to better set our students on pathways to career success.
