## Abstract

**Purpose** – This study aims to examine the impact of workplace happiness, coworker support and job stress on employee innovative behavior. The mediating effects of coworker support and job stress are also explored.

**Design/methodology/approach** – The study uses survey data from 328 employees from different departments in four- and five-star hotels in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Based on an extensive literature review, five main hypotheses were formulated and explored. These were tested through multiple regression analysis using the SPSS Process Macro plugin.

**Findings** – Workplace happiness is the most significant determinant of employees' innovative behavior, while coworker support plays a significant mediating role. Contrary to the study hypothesis and assumption, job stress alone is not a significant mediator; it only plays a mediating role when combined with coworker support.

**Research limitations/implications** – The sample is from a single sector (hotels) in a single country. Future research would benefit from examining the above relationships in other sectors (such as health and education) in the UAE. It could also explore the validity of these relationships in the tourism/hotels sector of other countries in the Middle East and Gulf regions.

**Originality/value** – Few studies have attempted to investigate factors that may promote or impede innovative behavior among employees in the hotels sector, particularly in the UAE. The data, model and findings of this study address this gap and add to the current state of knowledge.

**Keywords** United Arab Emirates, Job stress, Innovative behavior, Coworker support, Hotels sector, Workplace happiness

## 1. Introduction

The prime role of innovation in promoting socioeconomic prosperity has been a preoccupation of researchers and policy makers for several decades (Campo *et al.*, 2014; Bayraktar *et al.*, 2016; Jaiswal and Dhar, 2016). In particular, employees' innovative behavior in the workplace is considered an essential prerequisite for organizational survival (Hon *et al.*, 2016; Lee and Hyun, 2016; Hakimian *et al.*, 2016). Innovation and innovative behaviors have become increasingly important because of the changing economic environment, globalization and growing competing demands, hence the increasing research interest in this topic (Chen, 2011; Kim and Lee, 2013; Akram *et al.*, 2016).

Expectations of positive innovative behaviors are even more prominent in customer service-oriented organizations such as those in the hospitality industry (including hotels), wherein constantly changing customer expectations require employees with a tendency toward innovative behaviors. These organizations are now motivating their employees to be

more creative and innovative, expecting them to utilize these abilities to propose services that may improve overall service quality and performance (Chen, 2011; Kim and Lee, 2013; Luoh *et al.*, 2014; Dhar, 2015; Li and Hsu, 2016; Afsar and Badir, 2017).

Thus, identifying potential drivers of employee innovative behavior (e.g. workplace happiness, job stress and coworker support) remains an important research topic, particularly in the hotel industry. To date, relatively few studies have addressed factors affecting innovative behavior in this sector (Danaei and Iranbakhsh, 2016; Li and Hsu, 2016). This is surprising, given the key role and expectation of employee innovative behavior in this particular sector (Xerri and Brunetto, 2011; Wu *et al.*, 2014; Danaei and Iranbakhsh, 2016). One potential reason is that studies on innovation have focused more on macro-level parameters (Cainelli *et al.*, 2006; Ottenbacher, 2007; Camisón and Monfort-Mir, 2012), rather than on individual-level characteristics such as coworker support, job stress and workplace happiness. Research has only recently attempted to examine and incorporate these attitudinal characteristics (Danaei and Iranbakhsh, 2016; Li and Hsu, 2016).

The focus of our research, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) tourism industry, is an appropriate role model for other countries, because of its history of rapid development over the past decades (Henderson, 2007). For instance, Dubai (one of the major cities in the UAE) is ranked fourth among the Global Top 20 Destination Cities, with international overnight visitors reaching 15.27 million in 2016 (Hedrick-Wong and Choong, 2016), recording a healthy 5 per cent increase over 2015, and an impressive 8 per cent four-year (2012-2016) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (Dubai's Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing [DTCM], 2016). This impressive growth makes it necessary for hotel managers to enhance their operations. Innovation is a key lever to accomplish this. In addition, the hotels sector is now required to be more innovative in providing high-quality and unique services to attract customers to effectively survive the growing competition (Dhar, 2015; Luoh *et al.*, 2014).

Numerous factors potentially influence innovative behaviors, including workplace happiness, perceived coworker support and job stress. Innovative behavior refers to the creation and application of new ideas within an organization (Janssen, 2004). This study examines the effects of workplace happiness (WPH), coworker support (CS) and job stress (JS) on employee innovative behavior (IB). In addition, the study explores the potential mediating effect of coworker support and job stress in the relationship between workplace happiness and employee innovative behavior in that context.

Our study complements and contributes to the existing research in several ways. First, compared with group or firm innovation, employee IB receives less attention (Li and Hsu, 2016), and previous research tended to focus on manufacturing (rather than service) industries (Lee *et al.*, 2014; Lai *et al.*, 2016; Javed *et al.*, 2017). Second, this study attempts to develop and test a model that incorporates the effect of WPH, CS and JS on employee IB. In addition, the proposed model takes into account the potential mediating effects of CS and JS. Third, the vast majority of studies on attitudes and innovative behavior have been confined to countries outside the UAE in spite of the UAE's position as the most lucrative business market in the Arabian Gulf region and the most innovative economy among the Arab nations (Dutta *et al.*, 2016). In addition, Dutta *et al.* (2016) ranked the UAE among the top 38 innovation-driven economies. This emphasizes the need to examine employee IB and its antecedents in this particular context. Last, this study focuses on the UAE tourism industry, which recently became key to the country's economic diversification strategy (Callen *et al.*, 2014; Ahmed, 2015; WTTC, 2016).

## 2. Literature review and hypotheses

### 2.1 Workplace happiness and innovative behavior

In recent years, the concept of happiness in the form of well-being, positive attitudes, pleasant moods and emotions has attracted a great deal of attention (Fisher, 2010; Chia and Chu, 2016; Moccia, 2016; Salas-Vallina *et al.*, 2017). It is seen as a more precise and realistic assessment of employees' mood, which is somewhat broader and more accurate than the conventional concept of job satisfaction (Gupta, 2012). It is considered a prime ingredient of a range of social and psychological workplace manifestations. The main assumption is that genuinely happy individuals are more likely to engage in attitudes and behaviors conducive to improved organizational outcomes (Fisher, 2010; Roche and Rolley, 2011; Abdullah *et al.*, 2016; Chia and Chu, 2016).

WPH occurs when employees feel happy at work and see their work environment as something pleasurable and enjoyable (Salas-Vallina *et al.*, 2016). It includes all aspects of work that nurture "feelings of pleasantness, happiness, and positive well-being that make the work not just satisfying but also enjoyable" (Ford *et al.*, 2003, p. 23).

Another view of WPH emphasizes the individual's experiences of pleasures at work, which they normally expect to enjoy in their social environment (Albano, 2009; Wok and Hashim, 2015). This occurs when the workplace supports the psychological needs and civic aspirations such as meaning, autonomy, behavioral norms, feedback, supportive relations and personal growth. In this study, WPH refers to the perceived extent to which the workplace understands, supports and fulfills employees' psychological well-being (i.e. happiness) in pursuit of eudemonic happiness (Albano, 2009). It is considered a key driver of employee IB, as happiness at work can stimulate creativity, maximize performance and enable employees to achieve their potential (Pryce-Jones, 2011). In other words, when an employee feels happy, he/she will be more positive and relaxed in the work environment. This, in turn, is more likely to generate the necessary brain chemicals conducive to creativity and effective problem-solving (Anchor, 2010; Dolan and Metcalfe, 2012; Gupta, 2012; Abdullah *et al.*, 2016; Salas-Vallina *et al.*, 2017). When employees are in a state of peace or happiness, they will be more creative and innovative, leading to a positive organizational impact. Gupta (2012) found and strongly argued that happy employees tend to be significantly more productive, come up with innovative ideas, attempt to save time and enhance effectiveness by inventing new ways of work. Given the above arguments, one would expect:

H1. WPH has significant positive effects on employee IB at work.

### 2.2 Coworker support and innovative behavior

The concept of CS is based on the theory of social exchange. It considers that employees could form different social exchange relations with various partners within the workplace, such as their coworkers (Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005). Gouldner (1960) explains that the establishment of social exchange tends to enhance long-term relationship among partners. In turn, this leads to a greater collaboration and encourages emotional support among them.

CS is one of the fundamental social supports employees expect in the workplace (Ladd and Henry, 2000; Loi *et al.*2014; Li and Liu, 2017). It refers to "the extent to which employees believe their coworkers are ready and willing to provide them with work-related assistance to aid them in the accomplishing their duties" (Susskind *et al.*, 2003, p. 81). CS is not just task-related assistance but extends to include socio-emotional support such as love, care and empathy (Nugent and Abolafia, 2006; Rousseau *et al.*, 2009). CS may facilitate and encourage employees to exchange their knowledge and expertise, particularly when they are faced with

a complex and new task (Scott and Bruce, 1994). Similarly, they might obtain task-relevant expertise and knowledge of supportive employees (Perry-Smith, 2006). When an employee is surrounded by colleagues who are ready and willing to share their expertise and provide help to accomplish tasks, he/she is more likely to gain confidence in his/her ability to meet challenges and to become innovative (Zhou and George, 2001, Madjar, 2005). Working with helpful, supportive employees creates an environment where innovative ideas can be discussed more freely and openly, thus boosting the IB in the organization (Amabile *et al.*, 1996; George and Zhou, 2001; Prieto and Pérez-Santana, 2014; Li and Liu, 2017). Other studies found no significant relationship (George and Zhou, 2001; Binnewies and Gromer, 2012). Binnewies and Gromer (2012) explained their insignificant result is due to the specific nature of the job (teachers in their study). As teachers generally prepare lessons alone at home, support from coworkers may not be as essential to generate ideas as it is in other jobs.

Although the above linkages are logical and plausible, it is not certain that they would apply to employees in the hotels sector, especially in the UAE, hence the need to explore these relationships.

In addition, it is hard to conceive that CS can be the sole factor influencing IB. WPH needs to be present in the first place and may be a pre-requisite for CS. In other words, CS may only play a mediating role in the relationship between WPH and employee IB.

Therefore, when the organization nurtures a happy workplace environment (greater WPH), positive emotions between employees are generated. These, in turn, would lead to greater levels of CS (i.e. more support, more care, more empathy, more love and more knowledge sharing among employees), which are expected to lead to improved IB. Previous studies have alluded to this, suggesting that CS plays a mediating role (Montani *et al.*, 2012; Prieto and Pérez-Santana, 2014).

Based on the above arguments and literature, the following two hypotheses are proposed:

H2. CS has significant positive effects on employee IB.

H3. CS has significant mediating effects on the relationship between WPH and employee IB.

### 2.3 Job stress and innovative behavior

JS has been the focus of much research in recent years (Zeffane and McLoughlin, 2006; Zhao and Ghiselli, 2016; Mansour and Tremblay, 2016; Akgunduz, 2015; Jung and Yoon, 2016). Parker and DeCotiis (1983, p.161) indicate that JS “is a particular individual’s awareness or feeling of personal dysfunction as a result of perceived conditions or happenings in the work setting”. The concept of JS refers to the harmful emotional and physical employee responses that occur when job demands exceed capabilities, resources or workers’ needs (Sauter *et al.*, 1999).

Previous research examining how stress might affect IB is limited. Where studies have been conducted, the findings are not one-sided and remain parsimonious (Byron *et al.*, 2010; Ren and Zhang, 2015; Montani *et al.*, 2017). For example, Ren and Zhang (2015) found that the relationship between JS and idea generation depends on the nature of the stress. They argue that it could be positive if the stress is challenging in nature, such as time pressure. They also argue that it could be negative if the stress is considered as a hindrance, such as job insecurity. Other studies found no significant relationship between JS and IB (Janssen, 2000, 2004). In this regard, Janssen (2000) found a significant relationship between job demand (psychological stressors) and innovative behavior only when a moderating variable

(i.e. demand-reward fairness interaction) was introduced. This is a very interesting and noteworthy observation.

Despite all this, it is commonly understood and assumed that JS is counterproductive and hinders employee innovative capabilities (Bashabsheh, 2010; Saleem *et al.*, 2015). This is because higher levels of stress tend to reduce individuals' willingness to innovate.

Another explanation of the influence of stress on employee IB is to consider its indirect impact. It might be that JS could play a mediating role between WPH and IB. In other words, when employees enjoy a happy work environment, they are more likely to be innovative. However, if they simultaneously experience stress, they may or may not remain innovative (Roche and Rolley, 2011; Diener and Fujita, 1995; Emmons, 1992; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). This would indicate that JS may have a mediating/indirect effect. This is in line with recent studies indicating that JS plays a mediating role in the relationships involving IB (Malik, 2016; Li and Hsu, 2016) and should be explored.

Based on the above arguments and literature, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H4. JS has significant negative effects on employee IB.

H5. JS has significant mediating effects in the relationship between WPH and employee IB.

### 2.4 Theoretical framework

Drawing from the above assumptions and arguments, the research model is presented in Figure 1. The model proposes that WPH, CS and JS are indicators of IB. In other words, WPH and CS positively affect IB, while JS has a negative impact on IB. In addition, the model proposes that JS and CS mediate the relationship between WPH and IB.

## 3. Methodology

The theoretical model in this study is built according to a deductive research approach. In this approach, the relationships between the variables are best explained when researchers first collect data and (with the practice of rational reasoning) reach a conclusion that will either prove or disprove the hypothesis (Saunders, 2007).

### 3.1 Data and sample

Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of full-time non-managerial employees selected, through convenience sampling, from different departments of various four- and five-star chained-brand hotels across the UAE. This group is relevant for this study due to their vital, hands-on role in service delivery, close interaction with customers and coworkers and other daily operations. This study focused on four- and five-star hotels because of the

intensity of their in-house innovation, as reported by previous research (Leonidou *et al.*, 2013; Oliveira *et al.*, 2013). The targeted hotels are located in four major UAE cities/emirates, namely, Dubai (seven hotels), Sharjah (three), Ajman (one) and Abu Dhabi (two). Respondents were distributed as follows: Dubai (45 per cent), Sharjah (25 per cent), Abu Dhabi (20 per cent) and Ajman (10 per cent), indicating the geographical spread of the sample across four major tourist attractions in the UAE.

To maximize the response rate, the questionnaires were delivered in person by the researchers to hotel management. For this purpose, meetings were arranged with the appropriate managers (either the general manager or the human resource manager). In some cases, the management organized a formal meeting (involving several managers) at the university. The purpose of the first meeting with the hotel management was to seek their approval for the study and to request that they distribute the questionnaires among the staff in their hotel.

To preserve anonymity, respondents were not required to write their names on the questionnaire or provide any identifying clues. To comply with the university's strict ethics standards, a cover letter was attached to the questionnaire, explaining the purpose of the study, stressing that participation in the survey was purely voluntary and emphasizing that the data would only be analyzed on aggregate (i.e. no attempt would be made by the researchers to identify any respondents). In agreement with the hotel management, a box (clearly marked) was left near the reception for completed questionnaires, which were collected by researchers between November 4 and November 29, 2016. From 550 questionnaires, 328 usable questionnaires were collected, yielding a response rate of 60 per cent – an acceptable rate that exceeds the average for survey research of this type.

### 3.2 Measures

The questionnaire consisted of two sections. The first section contained the respondent's profile, while the second section contained the main variables of the study. The first section asked questions about the respondent's gender, age, level of education, department and years of experience. Section two responses were measured by close-ended questions based on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1). The variables of the study are as follows.

IB was operationalized via a six-item scale from Scott and Bruce (1994), which was modified based on Hu *et al.* (2009) employee IB scale focused on hospitality firms. CS was operationalized via a nine-item scale from Ladd and Henry (2000); WPH was operationalized via a 10-item scale from Albano (2009); and JS was operationalized via a 13-item scale from Parker and DeCotis (1983) (see Table II for the items' measures).

## 4. Analysis and results

### 4.1 Respondents' profile

Table I describes the demographic characteristics of the respondents in this study. Most of the respondents were male, between 21 and 30 years old, with a bachelor's degree and 4-8 years' work experience and were from the customer service department.

### 4.2 Reliability and validity tests

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the reliability and validity of the measures used in this study. The results are summarized in Table II, with details of the analysis in Table III.

First, the convergent validity of the main measures was tested. As recommended by Hair *et al.* (2010), convergent validity is estimated by examining the values of factor loading,

average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR). Items with factor loading lower than 0.6 were deleted (see Table II); two WPH items, namely, WPH1 and WPH2, were deleted. For JS, items JS4, JS6 and JS13 were removed because of low factor loadings. Hence, the factor loadings of remaining items were higher than the threshold of 0.6 as recommended by *Chin et al.* (1997). The AVEs, which represent the total amount of variance in the indicators of a latent construct, were all higher than the suggested threshold of 0.5 (*Hair et al.*, 2010). CR, describes the degree to which the indicators of a construct exhibit that construct, was higher than the suggested value of 0.6 (*Hair et al.*, 2010). In the next step, Cronbach's alpha (assessing the reliability of the variables) had values above the threshold of 0.7, as suggested by *Nunnally* (1978). To test the discriminant validity of the variables, comparison was made between the square root of AVE of each variable and correlations of that variable with other variables (*Fornell and Larcker*, 1981). Table III shows that the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlations, thus indicating adequate discriminant validity. Overall, the measurement model showed adequate reliability and discriminant and convergent validity.

Table III reports the mean, standard deviation and correlation of the main study variables. The highest average mean score is for WPH, followed by CS, IB and JS. The mean scores suggest that the hotels under study have high WPH and low JS. *Yang et al.* (2016) found a stress level of between 1.97 and 2.43 in an ageing population, which is lower than our mean score of 2.69. However, *Chia and Chu* (2016) found the JS level in the hotels sector to be 3.0, which is higher than this study's mean score. In addition, there is a relatively high

level of CS, which could be due to the high WPH in these hotels. The level of CS is close to the mean score of 3.73 reported by *Loi et al. (2014)* in their studies of hotels. Lastly, IB is considered high compared to the results in previous studies such as *Dhar (2016)* and *Dhar (2015)*, who found a mean IB in the service sector of 3.56 and 3.11, respectively.

The standard deviation indicates acceptable variability of between 0.72 and 0.81 for all variables. In addition, the correlation coefficients show that JS is negatively and significantly related to WPH ( $-0.39$ ), CS ( $-0.30$ ) and IB ( $-0.18$ ). Interestingly, JS has the highest link with WPH rather than with IB. Moreover, the WPH is strongly correlated with IB (0.59), suggesting an important link between them. This implies that the level of WPH is very important in creating innovative environments that support IB. WPH is also strongly related to CS (0.49), indicating that a high level of WPH is accompanied by a high level of CS. Lastly, IB is strongly linked to CS (0.56), suggesting that the higher the CS, the higher the IB.

### 4.3 Regression analysis

The five main hypotheses were verified by a two-stage statistical analysis. In the first stage, a test for the direct effects was conducted. The second stage focused on testing (for) and exploring potential indirect (mediating) effects. The results are summarized in Table V, with details of the analysis in Table IV.

Multiple regression analyses (MRAs) were performed to determine the direct impact of the three independent variables (i.e. WPH, CS and JS) on IB. The model is as follows:

$$IB_i = \alpha_0 + \delta_1 WPH_i + \delta_2 CS_i + \delta_3 JS_i + \varepsilon_i \quad (1)$$

Where  $\alpha_0$  and  $\delta_1 - \delta_3$  are the coefficients and  $\varepsilon_i$  is the disturbance term. The direct and indirect effects, as well as the hypothesis, are shown in Figure 1.

**4.3.1 Analysis stage 1: testing the direct impacts.** The results of the direct effects reveal that the three independent variables could collectively explain 46 per cent of the variance found in IB ( $R^2 = 0.46$ ,  $F = 85.5$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ). Inspecting the individual variables further showed that CS ( $\beta = 0.41$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ) and WPH ( $\beta = 0.52$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ) have a positive and significant impact on IB. This result supports *H1* and *H2*. Surprisingly, the relationship

between JS and IB, though positive, was not significant ( $\beta = 0.11$ ,  $p > 0.05$ ). Consequently,  $H_4$  was not supported.

**4.3.2 Analysis stage 2: testing the indirect impact.** In addition, the hypothesized indirect relationship between WPH and IB, through the mediators JS and CS, was tested using SPSS Process Macro Plugin, developed by **Hayes (2013)** and **Hayes and Preacher (2014)**. Their model combines the direct and indirect impacts of an independent variable on a dependent variable  $Y$  through three mediators. The model examined the paths through which WPH influences IB.

Employees' innovative behavior

The mathematical representation is:

$$M_1 = \alpha_{M1} + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_{M1} \quad (2)$$

$$M_2 = \alpha_{M2} + \beta_2 X_i + \varepsilon_{M2} \quad (3)$$

$$M_3 = \alpha_{M3} + \beta_3 X_i + \varepsilon_{M3} \quad (4)$$

$$Y = \alpha_Y + \gamma X_i + \beta_4 M_1 + \beta_5 M_2 + \beta_6 M_3 + \varepsilon_Y \quad (5)$$

Where  $M_1$ ,  $M_2$  and  $M_3$  are the mediators;  $X_i$  is the independent variable;  $Y$  is the dependent variable;  $\alpha_0$  -  $\alpha_3$ ,  $\alpha_{M3}$ ,  $\alpha_Y$ ,  $\beta_1$  -  $\beta_6$  and  $\gamma$  are coefficients; and  $\varepsilon_{M1}$ ,  $\varepsilon_{M2}$ ,  $\varepsilon_{M3}$  and  $\varepsilon_Y$  are disturbance terms. Accordingly, the following models are tested:

$$CS_i = \alpha_{CSi} + \beta_1 WPH_i + \varepsilon_{CSi} \quad (6)$$

$$JS_i = \alpha_{JSi} + \beta_2 WPH_i + \varepsilon_{JSi} \quad (7)$$

$$JS * CS_i = \alpha_{JS*CSi} + \beta_3 WPH_i + \varepsilon_{JS*CSi} \quad (8)$$

$$IB_i = \alpha_{IB} + \gamma_1 WPH_i + \beta_4 CS_i + \beta_5 JS_i + \varepsilon_{IB} \quad (9)$$

where  $\alpha_{CS}$ ,  $\alpha_{JS}$ ,  $\alpha_{JS} \times CS$ ,  $\alpha_{IB}$ ,  $\beta_1$  -  $\beta_5$  and  $\gamma_1$  are the coefficients; and  $\varepsilon_{CSi}$ ,  $\varepsilon_{JSi}$ ,  $\varepsilon_{JS} \times CSi$  and  $\varepsilon_{IB}$  are disturbance terms. This result is produced by running three models (i.e. equation (6), (7), (8), and (9)). Model number 9 [i.e. equation (9)] uses IB as the dependent variable to test  $H_3$ ,  $H_5$ , and  $H_6$ . Table IV presents the results.

Tests of the effects of CS indicate strong support for  $H_3$ , showing that CS plays a strong mediating effect ( $\beta = 0.18$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ). This also indicates that the path from WPH to IB through CS is established in this model. In other words, WPH affects employee IB both directly and indirectly through CS. Contrary to this, JS was found to have no significant mediating effects in the above relationships.  $H_5$  is, therefore, not supported.

No significant mediating effects were found for JS ( $\beta = -0.04$ ,  $p > 0.05$ ). This unexpected result led to an exploration of previous research emphasizing the usefulness of inserting cross-product (or a combination of) variables to test their predicting strength in comparison to the same variables when used alone (Harrison, 1992; Meyer *et al.*, 1998). Hence, the researchers created a dummy variable combining JS and CS and tested its strength in mediating the relationship between WPH and IB. The underlying logic is that

employees who experience a happy and enjoyable place, where the coworkers are supportive and encouraging, would overcome JS and be able to innovate. This is because happiness and strong support are likely to neutralize the negative effects of JS. Hence, JS combined with strong CS tends to play a stronger mediating role than either of these separately.

The present researchers tested for these combined effects by revising the above model and entering the combined (or cross-product) effects. The revised model is as follows:

$$IB_i = \alpha_{IB} + \gamma_1 WPH_i + \beta_4 CS_i + \beta_5 JS_i + \beta_6 JS_i * CS_i + \varepsilon_{IB} \quad (10)$$

Where CS, WPH, JS, IB,  $\alpha_{IB}$ ,  $\beta_4 - \beta_6$ ,  $\gamma_1$  and  $\varepsilon_{IB}$  are as mentioned above, and JS  $\times$  CS is the interaction effect of JS and CS.

Tests of the above model clearly show that the combined effects of CS and JS are quite significant, as mediators ( $\beta = 0.13$ ,  $p < 0.001$ ). This indicates that, even though employees may experience high JS, feelings of high CS interfere and neutralize and/or eliminate the negative effect of JS. These results are summarized in Table V.

Figure 2 illustrates the main findings of the above relationships.

## 5. Discussion and conclusions

### 5.1 Conclusions

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of WPH, CS and JS on employee IB, as well as to examine whether CS, JS and their combination mediate the relationship between WPH and employee IB in the UAE hotels sector. The two stages of the process model developed by *Hayes (2013)* and *Hayes and Preacher (2014)* were applied to this end. The first stage consisted of testing the direct impact of WPH, CS and JS on employee IB. In the second stage, the indirect impact between WPH and IB was tested, taking into account the potential mediating effects of CS and JS.

The results of the first stage of our analysis (i.e. tests of direct impacts) revealed that WPH positively and significantly affected employee IB. These findings are in strong support of *H1*, clearly indicating that the climate of the workplace (which includes moods and happiness) has significant effects on employees' positive emotions and motivation, thereby encouraging employees to engage in IB. These findings strongly support previous research (*Fredrickson and Branigan, 2005; Fredrickson, 2000; Kok and Fredrickson, 2010; Pryce-Jones, 2011; Gupta, 2012; Abdullah *et al.*, 2016*).

CS was also found to have a significant positive impact on employee IB, thus supporting *H2*. This could be expected; when employees enjoy high CS, they are surrounded by colleagues who are ready and willing to share their expertise and provide suggestions and assistance that would help in effective task accomplishments. This would provide a stimulus for innovation and innovative behaviors. These findings are in support of previous studies (*Zhou and George, 2001; Madjar, 2005*). In other words, when employees are exploring new ideas and receive support (and encouragement) from their colleagues, they are more likely to engage in creativity and endorse IB (*Amabile *et al.*1996; Zhou and George, 2001; Prieto and Pérez-Santana, 2014*).

Surprisingly, no significant direct relationship was found between JS and employee IB. Hence, *H4* was not supported. One possible reason for the insignificant relationship between JS and IB is the low level of JS (*Janssen, 2000*). Another possible explanation is that JS on its own does not have a direct effect on IB. Individuals experiencing high JS may or may not be innovative. This depends very much on the circumstances and the workplace context. It would appear that JS may operate with other factors in its effect on innovation. As already mentioned, this argument was also put forth by previous researchers such as *Janssen (2000, 2004)*. He found and argued that the relationship between job demand (psychological stressors) and innovative behavior exists only if there is demand-reward fairness interaction. This instigates the idea of interactive effects. In other words, the effect of JS is not necessarily direct, but more likely indirect (or interactive with another variable).

In terms of the indirect relationship, the study supports the mediating role of CS in the relationship between WPH and employee IB (partial mediator), providing support for *H3*. This is to say that when CS was included as a mediator in the relationship between WPH and IB, the strength of this relationship increased significantly. In addition, enhancement of WPH in hotels plays a significant role in creating a supportive environment between employees, which in turn leads to increasing employees' IB. This lends strong support to the findings of *Prieto and Pérez-Santana (2014)*.

Interestingly, JS does not have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between WPH and IB – possibly due to the fact that JS cannot by itself be a mediator. It works in conjunction with other variables such as CS. Clearly, high JS may be alleviated (or reduced) by the existence of effective CS. This is quite evident considering that individuals suffering high JS levels are more inclined to release their pressure by sharing their issues with

coworkers. Hence, the argument and findings on the combined effects of JS and CS seem more plausible.

The results involving the mediating role of JS and CS are very interesting and encouraging. They seem to indicate that the establishment of a happy work environment tends to reduce JS levels, especially if/when feelings of CS also exist. Stressful work environments require effective organizational support, including support from coworkers. The combined effects of JS and CS would play a significant mediating role. In other words, happiness at work would not on its own always encourage IB. Its effects would be stronger through the combined effects of the CS and JS relief mechanisms. The justification for such a result is that when CS and JS exist simultaneously, the effect of WPH on IB is more likely to increase than when only one of these (i.e. CS or JS) is present.

### 5.2 Theoretical implications

Although there are many studies focusing on innovation, the role of WPH, CS and JS in promoting IB has rarely been tested, particularly in hotel and hospitality industries. This study found that WPH and CS facilitate IB within the hospitality industry (i.e. the hotels sector). The evidence from this work builds on previous studies that highlight the impact of employees' motivation and attitudes on innovation (Luoh *et al.*, 2014; Hakimian *et al.*, 2016; Gkorezis, 2016). Moreover, the results extend our understanding on how WPH can create a positive feeling for employees, enlarging their capability for creative thinking and problem-solving. This positive feeling also creates an effective collaborative environment among employees (i.e. more support, more care, more empathy, more love and more knowledge sharing), in which innovative ideas can be discussed freely and openly; this can encourage IB in the organization. The current study adds to the existing body of literature by examining the combined effect of JS and CS on the link between WPH and IB. The combined effect has an intriguing result that opens a new direction toward further research on how the interaction can lead to higher IB.

### 5.3 Practical implications

This study findings strongly point to some benefits for managers and practitioners in the hospitality industry. The findings indicate that WPH is an essential ingredient for IB. This would suggest that managers and practitioners should nurture WPH through a variety of means, which include:

- making jobs more interesting and less boring;
- enhancing job security;
- encouraging teamwork and team culture;
- encouraging workers' participation in decision-making and involvement in the workplace; and
- encouraging a learning environment and knowledge sharing.

These would in turn lead to greater collegiality and CS, less JS, and thereby greater IB. In particular, they need to appease stress levels by cultivating team environments that would promote CS. The results are particularly important and useful to tourism and hospitality managers and policy makers in the UAE, given the importance of tourism and hospitality as key economic drivers (Callen *et al.*, 2014; Ahmed, 2015; WTTTC, 2016). In addition, the UAE government has repeatedly emphasized the need for innovation in these sectors as a way of promoting diversification and moving away from the economy's dependency on oil and gas

(Ahmed, 2015). Therefore, this research provides UAE hospitality firms (particularly hotels) with an empirical model for an integrated approach to increasing IB.

Employees' innovative behavior

### 5.3 Limitations and future research

Despite the usefulness of the findings, this study has some theoretical and practical limitations that could serve as a catalyst for future research. The main focus was on WPH as a key independent variable and its impact on IB. The mediating and interactive effects of JS and CS were also examined. While this exploratory model proved very useful and conclusive, future research could consider including other variables in the framework that could also have a major impact on employees' propensity to innovate. For instance, future research could include organization culture, leadership style and perceived organization performance. Second, this study is limited to hotels only; the tourism and hospitality industries incorporate a range of other sectors, such as transportation and food and beverage. Future research may consider these as a platform for study. Third, this study focuses on the UAE. Future research may consider testing the same variables and model in other national contexts, including neighboring countries with the same national strategy as the UAE (e.g. other Gulf countries).
