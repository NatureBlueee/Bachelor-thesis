## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course takes a strategic perspective on social change. It asks how emerging leaders – social entrepreneurs and strategic philanthropists – can stimulate systemic change through local interventions and collaboration. A social entrepreneur is a special type of leader. Social entrepreneurs draw on professionalism and market-based mechanisms to create positive change in the domains of education, enterprise development, the environment, fair trade, healthcare, human rights and other social fields. Combining their passion to solve social issues with an entrepreneurial outlook on life, they find innovative ways to leverage scarce resources in the pursuit of social value. Representing the vanguard of civil society in terms of effectiveness and adaptive leadership, social entrepreneurship has recently emerged as a major promise. It is becoming a new strategy space that is increasingly seen as a powerful alternative to traditional social policy and development interventions.

To help to turn the tide on the great challenges of the twenty-first century as exemplified in the Millennium Development Goals however, a quantum leap in terms of scale and impact is required, creating many more socially entrepreneurial institutions in a short period of time. This requires strategic action. One of the main constraints which social entrepreneurs face in scaling up is the availability of adequate sources of capital. They turn to multilateral agencies, governments, and the private sector. In addition, democratization, deregulation and the information revolution have greatly enlarged the space of options available to philanthropists. The course therefore analyzes the emergence and prospects for collaboration with a new type of actor, the strategic philanthropist. Not captive to the path dependency and risk aversion of multilateral agencies and governments, philanthropists can afford to take the long view and direct their efforts toward financing innovative approaches to the resolution of specific issues. Provided successful pilot efforts multiply, their global rollout can be accelerated in collaboration with established players in the development industry and social policy.

A major challenge consists of devising a mechanism that enables change agents on the ground and philanthropic financiers to collaborate effectively, as well as making more transparent what performance excellence means for social change initiatives, and how it can be measured.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to these issues. To be practical, it deploys a variety of case studies. The course is divided in five parts.

- *Part one* sets the stage by introducing the core conceptual material on social entrepreneurship and philanthropy.
- *Part two* looks into the issue of leverage – "where a lot of good comes from a little bit of good, where the positive social returns vastly exceed the amount of time and money invested" (Jeff Skoll) – and introduces the student semester projects.
- *Part three* asks how social change strategies can gain greater traction through attention to the efficiency of resource allocation in the areas of finance and the production of a good or service.
- *Part four* examines relevant trends for social entrepreneurs in the domain of finance: mission-related investment and alternative investment strategies.
- *Part five* unifies the different course themes, asking what the frontiers in social entrepreneurship are, and what they mean for social change, as well as providing a conceptual introduction to corporate social responsibility. Students present the status of their projects in class during the last regular class session.

## TARGET AUDIENCE AND COURSE OBJECTIVES

This course is directed toward young professionals who want to combine professionalism and entrepreneurship with the pursuit of a social purpose, aiming for careers in international and non-profit organizations, corporate citizenship units, and innovative wealth management divisions.

At the end of the course, students can expect to:

- Have gained a solid understanding of social entrepreneurship and philanthropy from a theoretical perspective, including several key case studies in the field;
- Be familiar with the overall strategy space of social entrepreneurship and philanthropy and possible points of insertion; and
- Be familiar with the student projects they will work on until the end of the term in small groups.

## INSTRUCTOR

Dr. Maximilian Martin is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Public Leadership at the University of St. Gallen and a Visiting Professor at the University of Geneva, where he teaches in the International Organizations MBA program. To help to develop a transmission channel for vanguard philanthropic capital directed toward social change initiatives, he heads the Philanthropy Services unit at UBS. He holds advanced degrees in anthropology and economics and a Ph.D. in economic anthropology. Coinciding with his tenure as a Fellow at the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School of Government (2000-2004), where he focused on social entrepreneurship and leadership research, he developed the first university course on social entrepreneurship in continental Europe for the University of Geneva in 2003. Dr. Martin's current research focuses on the relationship between globalization, enterprising public leadership (or social entrepreneurship) and philanthropy, and emerging value creation opportunities in this space. He also continues to pursue work on the political economy of Latin America and the Caribbean, as outlined in his recent book *Globalization, Macroeconomic Stabilization and the Construction of Social Reality* (2004).

## READINGS

Required readings ("R") will put relevant theory and practice and related texts for each topic at your disposition. The readings are selected from the course reading packet. Additionally, throughout the semester, the course packet readings may be supplemented with short current readings and handouts by email. You are expected to complete the readings and cases assigned for each session in advance of that session, and to attend class prepared to discuss the ideas set forth in the texts. On average, you should calculate six hours of reading time and preparation for each class session. The study questions are intended to facilitate your engagement with the articles and cases. Please prepare them well. They will serve as a springboard for class discussion. In case you would like to read further, there will be background readings. They are marked with an asterisk ("R\*"). They are recommended, but not mandatory. The reading list will be supplied prior to the beginning of the course.

## COURSE POLICIES AND TEACHING METHODOLOGY

This course assumes no previous knowledge except a reasonable command of English and a willingness to learn. Attendance is mandatory at all regular class meetings. English is the language of instruction. Enrollment is limited to 30 and the seminar is open to auditors upon consultation with the instructor only. The course consists of four days of sessions from November 17, 2006 – January 12, 2007, as specified above.

*Attendance and seminar participation.* 40% of the grade. Reflecting on his experience as a student at Oxford from 1740-1746, Adam Smith expressed a strong preference for "frontal" teaching:

"The teacher, instead of explaining to his pupils himself the science in which he proposes to instruct them, may [...] [make] them interpret it to him, and by now and then making an occasional remark upon it, he may flatter himself that he is giving a lecture." (Smith, *The Wealth of Nations*, Part III, Article II)

On the other hand, Smith was rather lenient with respect to attendance:

"No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the attending, as is well known wherever any such lectures are given." (Smith, *The Wealth of Nations*, Part III, Article II)

In line with standard practice at leading business and public policy schools, we will invert this procedure, in the firm hope that the number of voices in the class session is not inversely correlated with the quality of the lecture. Attendance is mandatory at all regular class meetings. Class discussion is an essential component of the course. Your full participation is expected in the discussion of the assigned cases, readings and general themes of the course. Be prepared to "open the case," and to actively participate.

*Final paper project and presentation.* 60% of the grade. The written deliverable of this course is a real-life project assignment on a social innovation. To this effect, you will work in a small group in close coordination with a social entrepreneur. By November 27, 2006, you will choose your topic from the assignment list and conduct project work on a social enterprise. You will assess the social enterprise's value promise and its contingency on factors such as the effectiveness of operations, positioning and strategy. The exercise will provide an opportunity to both put in practice the skills you acquired, as well as a quality networking opportunity in the social entrepreneurship community. Your project will be guided by a series of "how-to" questions, including:

- Does the organization operate with a credible theory of change? Is there room for improvement?
- What is the organization's approach to value creation? How can it scale?
- How much "bang" does one get for the "buck"? How can greater leverage be obtained, if at all?

In your project report, you will dedicate special attention to the strategic positioning the organization has chosen to make an impact in its chosen issue domain.

The written "end product" will be about 15 pages. For your project, you will draw on input from relevant parties – the social enterprise in question – and undertake additional research. The course project requires a total time commitment of 40 hours per student. The project topics will be undertaken in small groups.

*Writing, format, and citation.* Oral and written communication is a crucial part of the seminar. Development of good speaking and writing skills is essential to your success as a professional. A good paper has a clear thesis, is well organized, and employs solid logical analysis. Analytic arguments based upon verifiable facts must precede any value judgments you wish to make. Reflection-based arguments are useful only if grounded on one's genuine desire for sincere introspection and personal development. A good paper will address the problem posed by the assignment. Academic honesty requires that you properly cite all sources on which you rely for evidence. Students should strive for their papers being stylistically and grammatically correct and free of typographical and spelling errors. You should proofread your papers. Please use standard paper size, margins, font type, and font size (A4, double-spacing, Times New Roman font, 12-point).

*Late policy for written work.* All course requirements must be completed by the date on which they are due.

## QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS

I look forward to meeting with you to discuss the course and the written assignment, and will be available throughout the course of the semester via e-mail.

A Teaching Fellow will be available for review sessions. Students ought to consider the seminar as an opportunity to expand their skill set. We will seek to help you manage the workflow as productively as possible.

## SCHEDULE

## PART I: SOCIAL ENTERPRISE 101

Session 1: November 17, 2006, 10:00-12:00

### 1. Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship

This session provides an introduction to the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurs find new ways to solve social problems usually affecting large portions of the population via a strategic use of market mechanisms in areas such as poverty, healthcare, education and social inclusion – microfinance is perhaps the archetypical example. Social entrepreneurs' solutions are innovative, and are meant to be cost-effective, efficient, scalable and replicable. Are social entrepreneurs the innovative vanguard of civil society?

Session 2: November 17, 2006, 12:00-14:00

### 2. Introduction to Philanthropic Strategy

The initial drive of most philanthropists is personal and emotional: a tradition built on family values, a tragic experience, a passionate interest, a sense of duty to society. To achieve sustainability, deliver high-impact and yield long-term satisfaction to donors and recipients alike, one must also bring a strategic perspective and professional processes to bear on the design and implementation of the philanthropic program in order. How can a philanthropist translate his or her philanthropic aspiration into a feasible action plan? What are the steps to keep in mind, and how should one structure the process?

## PART II: THE QUEST FOR SCALE

Session 3: November 17, 2006, 14:00-16:00

### 3. Overview of Semester Projects

The six semester projects will be discussed in the session:

- Benetech, USA
- Manobi, Senegal
- Körber Foundation, Germany

A second option would be to write a paper on one of the following topic:

- Logistics and Transportation
- Water
- Climate change

Session 4: December 11, 2006, 10:00-12:00

### 4. Creating Leverage - Case Study: KickStart, Kenya

At first sight, it seems that there is a lot of money in philanthropy. In 2004, U.S. foundations alone (excluding corporate foundations) paid out grants of US\$28.8bn. And total non-governmental giving in the U.S. stood at US\$248.5bn (including corporate, individual, foundation, and bequest giving). If those figures are put into a broader perspective however, philanthropic resources appear to be relatively scarce. At the end of its first day of public trading in August 2004, Google was worth US\$27.2bn. In 2002, U.S. immigrants sent US\$30bn back as remittances to their countries of origin. In 2004, it took the U.S. government 40 days on average to spend US\$248.5 billion. 2004 net sales of Wal-Mart were US\$256bn. The relative scarcity of philanthropic resources renders leveraged interventions especially interesting. This session examines the case of KickStart (formerly ApproTec), a non-profit whose products enable poor rural Kenyans to increase their income roughly by a factor of 10, but does not fully recover its costs. A subsidy of US\$2m unlocks US\$41m in additional profits for KickStart's clients.

## PART III: EFFICIENCY OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION

Session 5: December 11, 2006, 12:00-14:00

### 5. Cost of Capital

This session examines the efficiency of capital allocation in civil society. The transaction cost of capital allocation in the US to nonprofit organizations – the combined cost of raising and disbursing funds - is estimated to be between 22-43 percent of the funds. This includes the fundraising costs of nonprofits, as well as the overhead expenses of foundations that disburse money. Compared to the for-profit sector, where cost of capital allocation is about 2-4 percent, this seems very high. What approaches can be taken to make the capital allocation process in the citizen sector more efficient?

Session 6: December 11, 2006, 14:00-16:00

### 6. Performance Measurement – Case Study: Solar Meninos de Luz

Social entrepreneurs are often torn between flexibility and measurement. The efficient production of a good or service requires an adequate allocation of scarce organizational resources such as money, staff capacity, and management attention. In business, formulating clear goals and establishing processes and mechanisms to allow for and measure the achievement of these goals best achieve this. On the other hand, effectively responding to social needs in dynamic settings will always require some flexibility. How can a social entrepreneur strike the right balance between mission-driven flexibility and requirements of performance measurement and accountability? The session examines the case of Solar Meninos de Luz, a Brazilian civil society organization working on improving children's health and education in two shantytowns of the city of Rio de Janeiro.

Session 7: December 12, 2006, 10:00-12:00

### 7. Displacing the Possibility Frontier – Case Study: Project Impact

The production of every good or service is limited by a production possibility frontier: different combinations of units of inputs  $\{x_1; x_2; \dots x_n\}$  will yield different units of output  $y$ . The disruptive nature of technology can completely turn around a social challenge by shifting out the possibility frontier: for example, the average cost of an intraocular lens that is needed for cataract eye operations fell from US\$125+ in the early to mid-1980s to less than US\$5 in 1992. But not all investments in new technologies are successful. In their quest for leverage, how can philanthropists and social entrepreneurs best harness the power of technological change to respond to the magnitude of social issues out there?

## PART IV: FINANCIAL STRATEGIES FOR SOCIAL CHANGE

Session 8: December 12, 2006, 12:00-14:00

### 8. Managing Endowments for Returns and Mission Alignment

In general, the management of an endowment seeks to achieve targeted returns on the monetary assets of a foundation, balancing the need for real capital preservation, the need to generate payouts to social programs without damaging the endowment, and possibly subject to certain ethical investment criteria. Effective endowment management requires a different skill set than program management. At times, this creates a paradox: the majority of a foundation's assets may be invested for financial returns only, completely disconnected from the organization's social mission. What are the relevant issues regarding asset class and investment manager selection? Which role can alternative asset classes realistically play in achieving a philanthropist's overall objectives?

Session 9: December 12, 2006, 14:00-16:00

### 9. Alternative Investment Strategies – Case Study: Hewlett Foundation

In 2004 grant-making foundations in the US managed US\$510 billion in assets, while disbursing US\$31.8 billion in grants. In order to better leverage its financial asset allocation for social impact, many foundation leaders currently explore two things: first, how to move beyond grant-making by means of an entire continuum of investments ranging from market-rate private equity to below market-rate social equity. Such investments, when made in mission or program related ways, can generate not only financial returns, but social returns as well. Second, how to access opportunities in alternative asset classes characterized by barriers to entry. This session explores the issues in question through a case study on the Hewlett Foundation.

## PART V: PHILANTHROPIC STRATEGY AND BUSINESS

Session 10: January 12, 2007, 10:00-12:00

### 10. Creating Greater Focus – Case Study: Edna McConnell Clark Foundation

By using tax exempted financial resources, charitable foundations face an implicit responsibility of using their resources well and ideally leveraging them – i.e. achieving more than the grant dollars of a single foundation can buy. In order to do so, a foundation is well advised to evaluate the contribution every element of its project portfolio makes. What does one need to keep in mind when reviewing a project portfolio in order to enable grants to be made more effectively, with greater focus, and greater impact? This session examines the case of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation.

Session 11: January 12, 2007, 12:00-14:00

### 11. Corporate Philanthropy

Businesses often use Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) defensively, as a stakeholder and reputation management device. But in reality, CSR could become part of the competitive assets of major corporations. Businesses possess unique bundles of competences – so-called "unique assets" – such as the ability to rapidly and reliably transport goods across continents at very low cost. This session discusses a strategic approach to CSR, bringing to bear a company's unique abilities on social challenges, can help to unlock powerful benefits for communities, while also helping to influence supply and demand conditions in ways that increase the long-term competitiveness of the company in question.
