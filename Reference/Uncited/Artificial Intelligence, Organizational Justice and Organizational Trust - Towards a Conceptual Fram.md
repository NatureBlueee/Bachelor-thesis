## I. INTRODUCTION

The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) into organizations has facilitated significant changes in new workplaces, changing work patterns and increasing efficiency [1]. In this process, relationships of trust and justice in organizations have emerged as important factors determining the landscape of AI integration. The complex interplay between AI, organizational trust, and organizational justice is an interesting but complex relationship worthy of academic research.

This study aims to demonstrate and explain the complex relationships between AI deployment, trust dynamics, and justice conceptions in organizational contexts. As AI systems become part of the decision-making process, their impact on building trust and correcting organizational requirements will be increasingly understood. This study attempts to synthesize existing data and draw key conclusions to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework, using the methodological rigor of meta-analysis. This conceptual framework aims to explain the complexities of AI and its implications for trust and justice, and act as a compass for

stakeholders navigating the transformation of AI-infused operational environments [2].

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between AI, organizational trust, and organizational justice through a critical examination of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and practical findings. In an era of technological innovation and digital transformation, these findings will have the power to drive strategic decisions, policymaking, and the design of AI systems that are relevant and actionable.

Significance of this study lies in its demonstration of how the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) will affect organizational dynamics, especially in relation to trust, justice and employee perceptions. Examining the role of adoption of AI effect on trust and justice in the workplace, it highlights key aspects that influence employee attitudes, behaviors and organizational performance. Understanding these dynamics is key for organizations looking to effectively implement AI, ensuring employee buy-in, satisfaction and successful organizational outcomes. The article offers insights that can guide AI implementation strategies and promote a more informed and balanced approach that considers the human aspect alongside technological development.

This paper is constructed as follows. Section 2 presents the literature related to AI in Organizational Contexts. Section 3 describes the Intersections of AI, Trust, and Justice, and the impact of AI on Justice and Trust at the organizational setting. Section 4 presents Methodology and the Proposed Conceptual Framework. Section 5 presents Concluding Remarks and Research Implications. Finally, a number of proposed future studies have been presented at the light of the proposed conceptual framework.

## II. LITERATURE REVIEW

### A. AI in Organizational Contexts

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a paradigmatic technological achievement that replicates human cognitive processes by developing intelligent systems capable of learning, reasoning and solving problems. AI and development can be divided into several areas.

Machine learning revolution: A period of change marked by the emergence of machine learning engines that recognize patterns and predict data [3]. Subfields such as neural networks, decision trees, and algorithms have increased in popularity [4].

Deep learning and neural networks: Advances have led to the renaissance of neural networks, especially deep learning models [4], which enable advanced pattern discovery and processing of unstructured data such as images, text, and audio. Deep learning technologies such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have driven advances in various fields.

### B. AI Adoption in Organizational Settings

The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into operational environments is rapidly being used in various industries [5]. Understanding the complexities of AI implementation is important to understanding the impact on trust and justice in organizations [6]. Here are some important aspects of AI adoption in your organization:

Strategic integration of AI: Organizations are adopting AI-based solutions to improve operational efficiency, streamline processes, and gain competitive advantage [7]. AI insights are often used to optimize resource utilization, improve decision-making, and stimulate innovation.

Despite the potential benefits, many challenges prevent the easy adoption of AI, including concerns about data privacy, security risks, and the ethical use of AI. Resistance to change, lack of AI capabilities in the workforce, and uncertainty about return on investment (ROI) are top concerns.

### C. Understanding Organizational Trust

#### Organizational Trust: Definition and Dimensions

Trust is defined as follows: a psychological state in which a person or group is willing to compromise the actions of another based on their opinions, strengths, honesty, and integrity. In organizational contexts, trust the honesty, integrity and kindness of others [8].

#### Dimensions of Organizational Trust:

Cognitive Trust: Based on past experiences or knowledge, cognitive trust is the belief in the other party and their abilities, reliability and predictability [8].

Affective Trust: Affective trust is motivated by emotional connection, affection, and interpersonal relationships in the organizational setting [8].

Behavioral Trust: The willingness to engage and cooperate based on reciprocity, ethical behavior, and shared ideas [8].

#### Trust in Technology and AI Systems

Reliance on technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), is an important factor influencing stakeholder interactions and decision-making in organizational settings. According to [9], to understand what it means to trust AI systems, you must:

Trust in an AI system is determined by its reliability and consistent performance in producing accurate results and performing specified tasks [9]. Authenticity increases user and stakeholder trust.

Transparency & Explainability: AI systems that make decision-making easier are more likely to be trusted by users. By removing uncertainty, understanding how AI algorithms work and how they make their decisions can lead to better confidence [9].

Human-AI Collaboration and Communication: Collaboration between humans and AI systems promotes trust by enabling people to better connect with AI technologies. Trust is built through user-friendly interfaces, ease of integration, and the ability to enhance human capabilities.

### D. Organizational Justice Frameworks

Components of organizational justice (Distributive, Procedural, Interactional)

Justice in the distribution of outcomes in an organizational setting and the methods used to produce those outcomes is called organizational justice [10]. There are several main components:

Distributive Justice: this aspect refers to the fairness of the results of management or the distribution of resources [10]. It refers to employee perceptions of fairness in the process of assigning wages, promotions, rewards, promotions, and other outcomes.

Procedural Justice: Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the methods, procedures, or methods used in the decision-making process. We value transparency, equality, fairness and participation in decision-making, regardless of the outcome.

Interactional Justice: The fairness of human treatment and communication in applying the decision is called interactional justice. This is divided into two parts. Human justice refers to the fairness and respect managers show in their relationships with employees. Information accuracy refers to the clarity and precision of information provided about decisions and their reasons.

#### Perceptions of Fairness and Justice

Employee attitudes, behaviors and satisfaction are influenced by their perception of fairness and justice in the

workplace. The following are important aspects of the concepts of justice and equity.

Employee perceptions of Justice are influenced by beliefs about fairness and equal opportunity for growth and success. Fair evaluations, merit-based promotions, and equal access to resources and development opportunities contribute to fair treatment.

Equality of rules and procedures: Perceptions of fairness are increased when the organization's rules and procedures are applied consistently and fairly to all employees. Ensuring that laws and regulations are properly enforced at all levels of the organization increases the perception of fairness.

#### *Relationship Between AI Implementation and Justice Perceptions*

Adding artificial intelligence (AI) to an organization's workflow can change employee and stakeholder perceptions of fairness. The relationship between AI implementation and correct reporting is defined by several factors:

AI-based decision-making processes: Fairness and openness in decision-making processes implemented through AI systems affect perceptions of fairness. The sense of fair judgment increases when we understand and trust the methods used by AI to make decisions [11].

Accuracy of Algorithm Output: AI algorithm outputs, such as recommendations, evaluations, or predictions, have significant implications for the notion of distributed justice. Ensuring that these outcomes are fair, impartial and consistent with organizational values will help increase perceptions of fairness.

Employee Involvement and Trust: Involving employees in the development or monitoring of AI systems can improve the quality of management judgment [7]. Awareness, employee training, and complaint resolution help create a perception of the accuracy of AI systems.

## III. INTERSECTIONS OF AI, TRUST, AND JUSTICE *Impact of AI on Trust Development in Organizations*

Researchers think that the introduction and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in operational workflows will have a significant impact on the creation and dynamics of trust between stakeholders. Below are the main trends that illustrate the impact of AI on the development of trust. Belief in AI reliability and performance:

The reliability and readiness of the AI system to provide accurate and reliable results influences the growth of trust [12]. When AI works all the time, trust begins to develop between users and fans.

Understanding and Defining the AI Decision: Users must trust in AI systems increases when the decision-making process is clear and transparent. Understanding how AI algorithms make independent decisions reduces uncertainty and increases trust.

### *AI's Influence on Perceptions of Organizational Justice*

The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational processes can have significant benefits for employee and stakeholder perceptions of organizational justice [13]. Some important criteria that show the impact of AI on organizational justice are:

Accuracy in AI decision-making: The accuracy and transparency of AI decision-making processes have a significant impact on perceptions of procedural fairness [13]. The perception of regulatory fairness is enhanced when AI systems use clear and precise decision-making processes.

Algorithm Output Equitability: The output of AI algorithms, such as applications, evaluations, and predictions, has significant implications for the concept of distributed justice [4]. Transparency is achieved by ensuring that these attributes are accurate, unbiased and consistent with organizational norms.

Employee involvement and trust: Involving employees in the development or oversight of AI systems can improve perceptions of organizational justice. Understanding, knowing and addressing all concerns will help create a vision for justice in AI systems [7].

### *Trust and Justice as Mediators or Moderators in AI Implementation*

Trust and perceived organizational legitimacy play an important role as mediators or facilitators in the successful integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational workflows [16]. Trust and fairness play an important role in:

The Mediating Role of Trust: Trust acts as a bridge between AI implementation and employee acceptance, satisfaction [14] and organizational outcomes. Acceptance and willingness to engage with AI technology will improve when people trust AI systems and believe they are reliable and accurate.

Organizational Justice's Mediating Role: The impact of AI on employee attitudes and behaviors is determined by organizational justice, which includes the perception of fairness in decisions and outcomes. When AI implementations are perceived as fair and reasonable, employees develop positive attitudes and behaviors [14].

Trust Moderating Role: Trust can moderate the relationship between AI implementation processes and organizational effectiveness. Increased reliance on artificial intelligence systems will increase the positive effects of AI adoption on employee engagement and organizational success [16].

Organizational Justice's Moderating Role: Organizational justice can limit the impact of AI implementation on employee morale, job satisfaction, and loyalty. The right ideas can negate the negative effects of AI adoption, ensuring better transfer and employee acceptance [16].

## IV. METHODOLOGY AND PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

Both of Meta - analysis and traditional systematic methods were used in the current study. In this regards, [17] refer that Meta-analysis provides a systematic approach for exploring the existing literature on a specific manner to determine whether a conclusion could be reached regarding the suggested relations. Meta - analysis is a collection of statistical methods that integrates the results of a large number of previous studied together for providing an aggregate summary of knowledge in a research domain [18]. In the current research The researchers' extracts information from each study comprising the meta - analytic database not to calculate an effect size from every single study, but to determine the nature of the relationships involved between all the variables included in the current research, and then employ the second methodology (traditional systematic methods to reach the final design of the proposed conceptual framework.

Figure 1: Study Proposed Conceptual Framework

The following is a discussion of the above relationships outlined in the conceptual framework figure, with the number of each paragraph depicting the representative number of relationship in the conceptual framework:

(1) According to the relation between AI and organizational justice perceptions, [19] examine different viewpoints on justice perceptions and why the fairness of decisions that made by managers and AI applications might be judged differently. In this context, they refer to that there is a highlight potential paradox in thinking about automation in general and intentionality of AI decision tools, and discuss the potential reflects on the use of these systems within HR in organizations. In this regard, [20] examine the importance of transparency and accountability in the use of AI in organizational justice. When employees are object to automation decisions that

made by AI systems and applications, it is necessary to ensure transparency and interpreting the content of these decisions. Employees need to understand how these decisions are made in order to improve the perception of organizational justice.

(2) According to relationship number (2), [21] examine the relationship between employees' trust in AI on one hand and general trust in technology, intra-organizational trust, and individual competence trust on the other hand. The results confirmed that employees' Trust in AI enhance organizational trust in general, whereas trust of employees in AI considered as a special category of trust in the broadest sense.

(3) According to the relation between both of AI, and Implementation AI Requirements on one hand and AI Competences on the other hand, [22] try to assess the user competence in employ artificial intelligence depending on validity and reliability of artificial intelligence literacy, at the same context, [23] explore the Impact of an Artificial Intelligence Research Frame on the Perceived Credibility, the results support these relations significantly.

(4) Recent studies indicate that cognitive trust is a strong indicator of adding new value through digital technology, especially artificial intelligence AI [24]. According to relationship number (4), [25] suggested that the availability of legislative, legal and ethical elements, as well as transparency, governance, support for privacy, equality and justice, are important elements in supporting trust and reliability in artificial intelligence.

(5) According to the relationship between organizational trust and organizational justice, it can be said that it is a bi-directional relationship. In this context, [26] investigate the impact of organizational justice on organizational trust, the sample size was 81 workers and civil servants working for the municipality of Betis in Turkey. The results reveals that there is a strong positive and significant relationship between organizational justice and organizational trust, in one of its findings, [27] found similar results where it has been proven that there were positive and statistically significant relationship between organizational justice and each of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and organizational trust.

(6) According to [28] examine The effect of transparency and trust on intelligent system acceptance, the results reveal that lacking of transparency could be lead to hinder trust and enforce aversion towards these systems. At the same context, [29] specific AI implementation traits associate with the relationship between user perception about reliability, transparency, and flexibility on hand, and AI trust on the other hand. Interaction comfort has a positive relationship with team members' trust towards AI, finally, Interaction enjoyment has a positive relationship with team members' trust towards AI, all of these relations will lead to trust on

supervisors, trust on colleagues, and trust on senior managers.

(7) According to trust in the context of implementing AI. It can be emphasized that the relationship between both of Perceived reliability of AI (PR), Perceived Transparency of AI (PT) and Perceived Flexibility of AI (PT) on one hand and cognitive trust in AI on the other hand, [30] developed a proposed framework to enhance cognitive trust in AI applications, through a survey that included (314) employees to verify the validity of the proposed conceptual framework that includes the three dimensions mentioned above, the results demonstrated the presence of a positive significance effects of these three dimensions on cognitive trust in AI. The results refer that is the high AI reliability, Transparency, flexibility, the more cognitive trust employees have in AI. At the same context, [25] pointed out that cognitive trust is an absolute necessity when dealing with advanced technologies that include complex processes such as artificial intelligence applications, the above review highlights that growing values among researchers in cognitive trust in AI. While existing literature primarily focuses on AI features such as transparency and reliability [31], [30] deploy employee individual-level perceptions on AI have potentials to indirectly shape AI value creation. Finally, [32] refer that trust in the AI promoter is positively related with cognitive trust in AI.

(8) According to the relationship between Cognitive Trust in AI and Organizational Trust, [25] stated that the development of trust and its elements will shape users' cognitive and emotional trust. their review reveals the significant role of AI's tangibility, transparency, reliability, and immediacy behaviors in developing cognitive trust, in addition, [33] identifies three types of trust experienced by AI chatbot users – emotional, cognitive and organizational – and develops a framework of experiential and sustained trust formation. It contributes to the information systems literature by demonstrating the critical importance of emotional and organizational trust in complementing cognitive trust, as well as the key design features that promote trust in AI chatbot use.

## V. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS

From the analysis of this conceptual framework, it can be concluded that the different paths which started from both of AI Dimensions, and Implementation AI Requirements to Organizational Trust -as ultimate variable- actually occur through multiple paths, these paths include other variables such as organizational justice, AI Competences, and Cognitive Trust in AI. All of these paths are supported by findings from previous studies. Depending on the mentioned conceptual framework, study also provides potential future research avenues as follows:
