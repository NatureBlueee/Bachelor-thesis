## Abstract

**Purpose** – This study explores how temporal social comparisons influence older construction workers' acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from younger colleagues within the context of the digital transformation of the construction industry. It aims to identify the underlying mechanisms of reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer and to examine the moderating role of age-inclusive HR practices, providing new insights into this dynamic process.

**Design/methodology/approach** – A quantitative research design was employed, with data collected from 239 construction workers in Dongguan and Shantou, Guangdong Province, China, using a structured questionnaire. The research adopted a time-lagged data collection method, gathering data every two months over three rounds to minimize common method biases. The study tested the hypothesized relationships using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM), offering a robust approach to analyzing complex relationships.

**Findings** – The results reveal that unfavorable temporal social comparisons do not directly lead older workers to acquire digital intelligence knowledge. Instead, future status threat and generativity motives fully mediate this relationship, highlighting the psychological mechanisms driving knowledge acquisition. Age-inclusive HR practices moderate the relationship between temporal comparisons and status threat but have no significant effect on generativity motives. The structural model explains a significant portion of the variance in the key variables, contributing valuable insights to the field.

**Practical implications** – This study offers practical recommendations for improving knowledge exchange among construction workers. By understanding the dynamics of reverse mentoring, managers can better manage status conflicts and utilize time perspective to foster more effective mentoring practices. Organizations should adopt age-inclusive HR policies to reduce intergenerational competitiveness, creating an environment that promotes cooperative incentive systems and better intergenerational collaboration.

**Originality/value** – This study makes a unique contribution by uncovering the mediating mechanisms through which temporal social comparisons influence digital knowledge acquisition and by identifying the boundary conditions for reverse mentoring in the construction industry. It introduces a novel perspective on the role of age-inclusive HR practices in facilitating knowledge transfer, extending the literature on intergenerational learning and digital transformation. This research provides practical implications for improving workforce management and fostering intergenerational knowledge exchange in industries undergoing digital change.

## Introduction

Due to the advent of the information technology era, construction workers must operate an increasing number of information technology devices, such as construction site intelligent robots (Liang et al., 2021), intelligent VR wearable devices (Pooladvand et al., 2021), the internet of things (Ernstsen et al., 2021). However, young construction workers and older construction workers accept new information technology equipment to different degrees. As construction workers age, the information technology job drive of the organization makes their performance decrease gradually (Li et al., 2022). To reduce the negative consequences of information technology for the aging workforce, General Electric, one of the “Fortune 500 companies,” developed a reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer system (Meister and Willyerd, 2010), in which young colleagues mentor older employees and share digital intelligence knowledge (Pfrombeck et al., 2023). Before the emergence of digital intelligence technology, this reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer system could not exist because older employees usually guide younger employees in the workplace (Chaudhuri et al., 2021). But the popularity of digital intelligence technology, especially the rise of artificial intelligence, has made reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer increasingly valued by academia and businesses (Pfrombeck et al., 2023). Such intergenerational sharing and receiving of knowledge can help prevent organizational knowledge loss and ensure business sustainability. However, reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer is not smooth, as older employees, who need digital intelligence knowledge, lack the motivation and the ability to learn (Kaše et al., 2019), whereas young colleagues, who possess digital intelligence knowledge, lack the motivation to share it (Chaudhuri et al., 2021).

Reverse intergenerational transfer is the act of transferring new knowledge and skills from younger to older employees and is an important means of achieving knowledge alternation between new and older employees and improving the quality of workers' skills. First, generational differences among employees cause tensions in terms of values, behaviors, and identities, thereby hindering knowledge transfer between talented young colleagues and older employees (De Boom and De Meulenaere, 2024; Duan et al., 2024). Second, from the perspective of knowledge sharing, young employees can naturally learn and progress through knowledge transfer (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011); however, when sharing knowledge with older colleagues, the knowledge transfer behavior of young employees may be criticized by older colleagues, influenced by the concept of knowledge acquisition between generational groups or the notion of high-power distance (Drury and Fasbender, 2024; Lu and Zhou, 2024). Consequently, young colleagues may hesitate to conduct intergenerational knowledge transfer to avoid adverse evaluations. Third, from the perspective of knowledge acceptance, it is difficult for older employees to develop motivation to continue learning new knowledge and skills once they are close to retirement or perceive no hope for promotion (De Boom and De Meulenaere, 2024). In contrast to the currently popular knowledge-seeking perspective, this study focuses on the reverse process of knowledge-seeking, in which older employees seek knowledge from younger colleagues. It is argued that older employees need to frequently update their existing knowledge to cope with ongoing changes in the organization (Lu and Zhou, 2024).

This study offers novel contributions by focusing on reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer, where older workers actively seek digital intelligence knowledge from younger colleagues, a shift from the traditional focus on knowledge transfer from older to younger employees. This approach is particularly relevant in industries like construction, where the aging workforce faces challenges in adapting to new technologies. Additionally, Social Comparison Theory is extended by introducing temporal social comparison, where employees compare their past and future trajectories with those of their colleagues. This dynamic comparison is crucial in understanding knowledge acquisition in rapidly evolving industries. Finally, the research highlights the role of age-inclusive HR practices in facilitating knowledge transfer. While much of the existing literature focuses on reverse mentoring (Fasbender and Gerpott, 2022), this study emphasizes how organizational policies can reduce intergenerational competition and encourage cooperative knowledge sharing.

## Theory and hypotheses

This section focuses on constructing a theoretical model of the digital background and exploring the mechanisms by which unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger colleagues affect reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer. It is argued that unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues influences intergenerational digital intelligence knowledge acquisition among older employees, and that organizationally different contexts explain this relationship. Therefore, a targeted moderating variable is proposed: age-inclusive HR practices (Oliveira, 2021). Additionally, future temporal social comparison differences between different age groups can be measured using generativity and developmental motives, defining generativity motives as valuing or favoring job characteristics and outcomes (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011).

Social Comparison Theory (SCT) refers to the idea that people compare themselves to make accurate self-evaluations (Festinger, 1954). Social comparisons occur automatically (Greenberg et al., 2007), meaning that employees engage in such comparisons spontaneously, and doing so requires relatively little effort (Gilbert et al., 1995). With an in-depth study of social comparison theory, scholars, no longer confined by static comparative studies, consider social comparison from a dynamic perspective of time. Transforming Festinger's concept, Albert established the temporal social comparison theory (TCT) in 1977, and pointed out the differences between the two theories: (1) temporal social comparison refers to the comparison of the same person, rather than the comparison between people, and (2) temporal social comparison emphasizes temporality and is a comparison of different self-descriptions at different times. From a time-social comparison perspective, people evaluate others based on their personal attributes and life trajectories (Vogel et al., 2020). That is, when evaluating others, they continue to develop their career trajectory over time; therefore, employees' evaluative judgments about their colleagues' future status are guided by their colleagues' current development and career trajectory. Indeed, employees compare their past development with their colleagues' and use these temporal trajectories to make assumptions about their potential future status (Zell and Strickhouser, 2020). Existing studies have explored reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer in various organizational settings, primarily focusing on mentoring relationships (Singh et al., 2021) and informal workplace learning (Geisen et al., 2024). However, research on older construction workers actively seeking digital knowledge from younger colleagues remains limited. Previous studies have primarily examined knowledge transfer from a mentoring perspective, emphasizing the role of older employees as knowledge providers rather than seekers (Yung Chou et al., 2014). This study shifts the focus to the motivational and organizational factors that drive older workers to acquire digital intelligence knowledge, addressing a critical gap in the literature.

In the face of new digital intelligence technologies, older employees tend to develop unfavorable temporal social comparisons because they believe their younger colleagues' status will be higher than their own in the future (Annosi et al., 2024; Ayoobzadeh et al., 2024). When older employees realize that the cause of this unfavorable situation is mainly their own lack of wisdom, skills, and knowledge, they actively acquire the corresponding wisdom and knowledge from their younger colleagues. Therefore, it is proposed:

H1. The stronger the unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues, the more likely the older employees will facilitate acquiring digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues.

Older employees perceive a strong threat to their status when they realize that their younger colleagues' status will be higher than their own in the future (Reh et al., 2022). They realize that they will be physically or psychologically harmed, with insufficient resources to cope (Reh et al., 2018), which often comes from comparisons with others; that is, a future status threat (Reh et al., 2022). The future status threat is an internal assessment and older employees' judgment about their future status. When they feel that someone threatens their status and prestige, they try to defend or restore their status (Reh et al., 2018). When they

realize that the cause of this threat is their own lack of digital intelligence knowledge, they are motivated to acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues to narrow the gap. Thus, unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues motivates older employees to acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues through future status threats.

H2. Future status threat mediates unfavorable temporal social comparison between younger and older colleagues; older colleagues tend to acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues.

Generativity motives, which refer to positive, self-improvement-oriented motivation aimed at improving an employee's own status, such as learning knowledge and skills from more successful and hardworking colleagues to break out of their current rut (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011). For employees at the end of their careers, they often lack the motivation to learn new knowledge and skills from other colleagues (Chang et al., 2023), but when older employees develop unfavorable temporal social comparisons with young colleagues (Fasbender and Gerpott, 2022), in addition to perceived future status threats, they also develop the motivation to improve their status. This implies that older employees with generativity motives are more incentivized to learn knowledge and skills. Therefore, it is posited that unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues will enable older employees to acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues through generativity motives.

H3. Generativity motives mediate unfavorable temporal social comparisons with young colleagues and the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues.

Older employees usually have a higher status in the organization based on their organizational tenure, skills, and work experience. However, this status difference may change in the future, as younger colleagues strive to obtain a higher future status and develop their careers (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011). When considering knowledge transfer in an increasingly age-diverse workforce, the trajectories of employees and their potential future status must be considered. Older employees may be aware that younger colleagues who are currently “harmless” will climb the career ladder and become competitors for future status, as both younger and older employees seek higher-level positions. Specifically, engaging in social comparisons and recognizing themselves as being worse than their younger colleagues (unfavorable social comparison) implies that older employees perceive younger colleagues as having higher future status (Reh et al., 2018). Thus, older employees will feel threatened by their future status. It is proposed:

H4. Unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger colleagues can lead to older employees perceiving a future status threat.

Socioemotional selectivity theory states that generativity motives are more prominent when time is perceived as limited because short-term emotionally meaningful goals are prioritized when time is exhausted (Carstensen, 2006; Lang and Carstensen, 2002). When time is considered abundant, people's preparation goals of focusing on collecting information, experiencing novelty, and expanding knowledge breadth are prioritized. However, when time is considered limited, the most prominent goals will be those that can be achieved in the short term (Carstensen, 2006), such as how older employees who are about to end their careers will consider how to avoid being eliminated. Therefore, individuals with limited temporal social comparisons (i.e. older employees) will have higher generativity motives (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011). It is proposed the following:

H5. Unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues can lead to higher generativity motives in older employees.

Furthermore, though acquiring intergenerational digital intelligence knowledge can be helpful for older employees at the end of their careers, this status-quo-challenging behavior is often influenced by individual emotions, motivations, and organizational environment (Fasbender and Gerpott, 2022). Older employees may cautiously choose to not interact with young colleagues to gain wisdom and reduce unnecessary resource depletion (Kaše et al., 2019). However, research has shown that older cohorts' anxiety about digital technology use diminishes as they receive more training (Xie et al., 2023), which is consistent with the exploration of intergenerational knowledge transfers in this study.

The source of anxiety seems to be younger colleagues' mastery of new digital intelligence technologies and knowledge, which leads to older employees' fear of future status loss (Fang, 2017; Xie et al., 2023). People with high status have higher subjective well-being and seem to be healthier, have more self-respect, and are more influential (Reh et al., 2022), receiving more respect and support from others (Renger et al., 2024). Conversely, low status triggers negative emotions (Kemper, 1991) and impairs performance (Marr and Thau, 2014). People are particularly sensitive to a low or lost status (Lange and Crusius, 2015; Carson Marr et al., 2019). When organizational members become aware of their future status being threatened, it motivates affected individuals to take action (preemptively) and close the gap (Wu et al., 2024). Accordingly, it is proposed:

H6. Perceiving future status threats facilitates older employees' motivation to acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues.

Furthermore, generativity motives encourage knowledge transfer between different age groups (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011; Fasbender and Gerpott, 2022). This motivation is expressed as a positive, self-improvement-oriented motivation to enhance employees' status, such as learning knowledge and skills from more successful and hardworking colleagues, to break out of existing dilemmas (Lange and Crusius, 2015). It is argued that the stronger the generativity motives of older employees in the context of an organization's digital transformation, the greater the need to learn digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues.

H7. Generativity motives encourages older employees to acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young colleagues.

Age-inclusive HR-practices are a range of HR practices designed to provide equal opportunities to employees of all age groups in recruitment, training and development, promotion, and management support (Oliveira, 2021). Age-inclusive HR-practices ensure that all employees, regardless of age, develop their knowledge, skills, and competencies and are offered the same opportunities to contribute to organizational goals. Older employees are more likely to feel motivated to develop their skills when there are more age-inclusive HR-practices (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011), as such practices ensure equal access to resources and career opportunities for older employees (Hans et al., 2023), regardless of whether young colleagues are likely to surpass them in the future. Organizational age-inclusive HR-practices moderate the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparisons with young colleagues and future status threat. The positive effect of unfavorable temporal social comparisons with young colleagues on the future status threat is weaker in organizational settings with higher levels of age-inclusive HR-practices.

H8. Age-inclusive HR-practices negatively moderate the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues and future status threat. That is, the higher the degree of age-inclusive HR-practices, the likelier it is that the positive effect of unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues on future status threat will be diminished.

Simultaneously, organizational age-inclusive HR-practices can positively moderate the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues

and generativity motives; that is, the positive effect of unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues on generativity motives will be stronger in organizational settings with higher levels of age-inclusive HR-practices. Such practices ensure that all employees, regardless of age, develop their knowledge, skills, and abilities and are given the same opportunities to contribute to organizational goals. Older employees are more likely to put their generativity motives into practice when age-inclusive HR-practices are higher (as opposed to lower) (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011) as such practices ensure equal access to resources and career opportunities for older employees (Hans et al., 2023).

H9. Age-inclusive HR-practices positively moderate the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues and generativity motives. When age-Inclusive HR-Practices are higher, the positive effect of unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues on generativity motives is enhanced.

Based on the integration of mediating and moderating variables, it is proposed a hypothetical integrated model: the degree of unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues influences future status threats and generativity motives, which further influence the behavior of older employees in intergenerational number-wise knowledge acquisition; furthermore, age-inclusive HR-practices moderate this relationship. Figure 1 illustrates the theoretical model.

relevant industries. For sample selection, this paper mainly focuses on the staff in the construction business. The age of the subjects is restricted to 40 years old or above, that is, only employees born on or after January 1, 1974 are surveyed. An inter-temporal approach is adopted to collect questionnaires, so as to avoid the serious impact of homogeneity errors on the research results. The participants are construction workers from the construction business in Dongguan and Shantou, Guangdong Province, China. This study examines construction workers in Dongguan and Shantou, Guangdong Province, China, selected due to their industrial significance and high proportion of aging workers facing digital adaptation challenges. These cities serve as ideal sites for studying reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer in the construction industry. Additionally, the research team is based in this region, which facilitated data collection and industry access, ensuring a contextually relevant investigation. While geographically specific, the sample represents older construction workers in rapidly urbanizing areas, making the findings applicable to similar environments experiencing workforce aging and digital transformation. In order to strengthen the scope of the research, the type of work of construction workers was not limited, as long as they were subject to the role of construction workers. Data collection was conducted from October 2023 to April 2024, with sample data being collected only after obtaining consent from the supervisors of 300 participants. Participants were informed that the sole purpose of the study was academic research, and that the data would be kept confidential. It was also clarified that participation in the survey was voluntary, and each respondent received a reward of RMB 30. A multi-time point data collection method was adopted, with data being collected every two months to avoid common method biases (CMB) (Podsakoff *et al.*, 2003). The first research tasks are agreed upon with the construction Supervisor in advance: assigning tasks first and then informing the task deadline at intervals. After the construction Supervisor assigns the task via the WeChat group or verbally, the research team immediately gives the construction worker an electronic or paper version of the questionnaire to obtain participants' personal and contact information. This phased approach allowed the research team to observe changes over time while reducing the risk of consistency bias. The first round, conducted in October 2023, involved 300 construction workers from Dongguan and Shantou, Guangdong Province, China, with 284 valid responses retained after excluding incomplete and inconsistent data, focusing on baseline data related to temporal social comparison and initial knowledge acquisition behaviors. The second round followed with the same participants, measuring perceived future status threat and generativity motives, yielding 264 valid responses after accounting for dropouts and non-responses. The third round collected data on age-inclusive HR practices and reassessed digital intelligence knowledge acquisition, resulting in a final dataset of 239 valid responses, with missing or non-matching data excluded to ensure the integrity of the dataset. Information on participant demographics is shown in Table 1.

### Measures

Several steps were undertaken to ensure the reliability and validity of the instrument. International journals were searched to identify reliable scales for studies published by authoritative sources that have been validated in the Chinese context. Because the scales were developed in an English-speaking context, a translation-back translation process was used to adapt the scales for the questionnaire. A 5-point Likert scale was used to measure the variables, ranging from “1 = strongly disagree” to “5 = strongly agree.”

### Variables and scales

All items for each construct were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). These values were adapted from previous studies published in high-impact scientific journals.

#### *Unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger construction workers (independent variables)*

Unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger construction workers was measured using an eight-item temporal social comparison scale (Brown *et al.*, 2007), to measure the extent of unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers. Examples include: “I compare myself to young construction workers who are better off than me at work in terms of performance.”

#### *Acquire digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers (dependent variables)*

This was measured using a four-item scale (Wilkesmann *et al.*, 2009) to assess to what extent older construction workers acquired digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers. Examples include: “I learn a lot by observing young construction workers doing their digital job,” and “I learn a lot of digital intelligence knowledge by asking young construction workers.”

#### *Generativity motives (mediating variables)*

Measured using a three-item scale (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011), this scale was used to measure the extent of the developmental motives. Examples include: “How important is the opportunity to share your skills with younger people for you?” and “How important is the opportunity to pass your knowledge on to the next generation?”

#### *Future status threat (mediating variables)*

Participants were asked about their expected future status relative to others to assess future threats. The 4-item Expected Future Status Scale developed by Pettit et al. (2013) was adapted to assess an individual's status, prestige, recognition, and admiration within an organization.

A sample item is: “soon, young construction workers will have higher status in the organization than I will have.”

#### *Age-inclusive HR-practices (moderating variable)*

The age-inclusive HR-practices was measured using a five-item scale adapted from Boehm et al. (2013). Sample items include does your organization: “offer age-neutral recruiting activities?” and “offer equal access to training and further education for all age groups?”

#### *Control variables*

Because previous research generally used demographic variables as control variables, this study also controlled for such variables as sex, age, education, and job tenure.

## Results

### *Descriptive analysis*

The average scores of unfavorable temporal social comparison, acquisition of knowledge from young construction workers, future status threat, generativity motives and age-inclusive HR-practices were  $3.47 \pm 1.11$ ,  $3.38 \pm 1.06$ ,  $3.33 \pm 1.19$ ,  $3.34 \pm 1.01$  and  $3.50 \pm 1.02$ .64% were female, 58.6% were bachelor's degrees, 33.5% were 3–5 work age, 56.9% were married (Table 1).

#### *Results of indicator loadings*

As shown in Table 2, each factor loading greater than 0.7 usually indicates a high correlation between the measured indicators and latent variables, good questionnaire structure validity, and high data quality, indicating that the questionnaire design and data are in good condition. The observed variables can effectively reflect the latent factors and can be comprehensively judged in combination with other indicators and research objectives.

### *Correlation among study variables*

Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significantly negative association between anxiety and social support, along with its three dimensions (Table 3). Nevertheless, a positive correlation was found between anxiety and depression. Likewise, the three dimensions of social support showed positive correlations with each other.

**Common method bias test.** To exclude common method bias, the data were examined using Harman's one-way test (Podsakoff et al., 2003). An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on 25 topics, including unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger construction workers, acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from younger construction workers, future status threats, generativity motives, and age-inclusive HR practices, using SPSS 25, with a fixed sample of one factor. The results showed that the factor explaining 45.66% of the variance was less than 50% (Hair et al., 2014), indicating that the common method bias was within acceptable limits.

**Measurement model.** The structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was conducted using Smart-PLS 4 software, which is widely recognized for its application in partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Smart-PLS was chosen due to its capacity to handle complex models with both direct and indirect effects, as well as its suitability for small to moderate sample sizes. Bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples was applied to assess the significance of path coefficients and ensure the robustness of the results (Hair et al., 2014).

The measurement model examines the hypothesized links between the indicators and latent constructs, whereas the structural model estimates the paths between the exogenous (independent) and endogenous (dependent) latent constructs.

PLS was used to assess the reliability and validity, the results of which are shown in Table 3. The composite reliability of all the constructs was above 0.7, indicating good internal consistency. Table 4 also shows that all average variance extracted (AVE) values are greater than 0.5, and the square root of the AVE for each construct is greater than the correlation of the other constructs. All factor loadings were above 0.8, and the factor loadings of each latent variable were greater than the cross-loadings of the other latent variables, revealing that the

constructs have good convergent and discriminant validity. Additionally, Table 5 shows that all ratios of the heterogeneous-monotrait correlation ratio (HTMT) for each construct are less than 0.9, indicating good discriminant validity. Therefore, these statistics indicate that the study measures are valid and reliable; thus, the proposed hypotheses can be further analyzed.

#### Results of bootstrapping test and PLS-predict analysis

The bootstrapping method (95% bias-corrected confidence interval, bootstrapping sample  $N = 5,000$ ) was used to calculate the t-statistic and standard error. The PLS-Predict analysis yielded  $Q^2$  values of 0.727 for future status threat, 0.462 for generativity motives, and 0.471 for knowledge acquisition, all exceeding the threshold of 0, indicating strong predictive relevance of the model. The results of the path analysis and bootstrapping test are shown in Table 6. The relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger colleagues and the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers was not significant ( $\beta = -0.012, p > 0.05$ ) and did not support Hypothesis 1. The mediating effect of future status threat ( $\beta = 0.091, p < 0.01$ ) and generativity motives ( $\beta = 0.167, p < 0.01$ ) between unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger construction workers and the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers was significant, supporting the Hypotheses 2 and 3. Unfavorable temporal social comparison with younger construction workers positively affected future status threat ( $\beta = 0.161, p < 0.01$ ), supporting Hypothesis 4. Unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers positively affected generativity motives ( $\beta = 0.695, p < 0.01$ ), supporting Hypothesis 5, whereas future status threats positively influenced the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers ( $\beta = 0.564, p < 0.01$ ), supporting Hypothesis 6. Generativity motives positively influenced the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers ( $\beta = 0.240, p < 0.01$ ), supporting Hypothesis 7. The main effect does not hold, suggesting that future status threats and

Generativity motives fully mediate the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers and the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers. Table 6 shows that the interaction terms between unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers and age-inclusive HR-practices exert a significant negative effect on future status threat ( $b = -0.122$ ,  $p < 0.01$ ), indicating that age-inclusive HR-practices can significantly moderate the relationship between unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers and future status threat. Table 6 also shows that the interaction terms between unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers and age-inclusive HR-practices exert no effects on generativity motives ( $b = 0.032$ ,  $p > 0.05$ ), did not support Hypothesis 9.

Figure 2. Structural model with moderator variable

with younger construction workers, future status threats, and generativity motives. As shown in Figure 2, the structural model explains 73.3% of the variance in future status threats, 48.0% of the variance in generativity motives, and 50.0% of the variance in the acquisition of digital intelligence knowledge from young construction workers.

To better understand the moderating effect, a simple slope test was conducted, and it was found that unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers exert no significant effect on future status threat ( $b = -0.018, p > 0.05$ ) under the high level of age-inclusive HR-practices (Mean + 1SD). Meanwhile, unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers exerts a significant positive effect on future status threat ( $b = 0.300, p < 0.01$ ) under the low level of age-inclusive HR-practices (Mean - 1 SD). This indicates that unfavorable temporal social comparisons with younger construction workers has a stronger promoting effect on future status threat under the low level of age-inclusive HR-practices compared with the high level of age-inclusive HR-practices. **Hypothesis 8** is partially supported, and the moderating effect is shown in Figure 3.

## Discussion

In the information age, reverse thinking has become increasingly common in the workplace. However, most existing literature is one-sided, concluding that reverse mentoring benefits or harms individuals' behavior (Kaše et al., 2019; Chaudhuri et al., 2021). Moreover, despite being in the knowledge economy, there has been little research on the impact of temporal social comparison on individual knowledge resources (Fasbender and Gerpott, 2022). Therefore, by surveying 239 construction workers in China, this study explored the impact of temporal social comparisons on knowledge acquisition. The results indicate that unfavorable temporal social comparisons do not directly motivate older employees to acquire digital intelligence. Instead, future status threat and generativity motives fully mediate this relationship. Additionally, age-inclusive HR practices moderate the impact of unfavorable comparisons on status threat but do not significantly affect generativity motives.

The two unsupported hypotheses may be attributed to several factors. First, the lack of a direct effect of temporal social comparison suggests that unfavorable comparisons alone are insufficient to drive older workers to acquire digital knowledge. Other factors, such as self-efficacy or prior experience with technology, may play a more substantial role in this process. Second, the absence of a significant moderating effect from age-inclusive HR practices on the relationship between temporal social comparison and generativity motives implies that

Generativity is more influenced by personal values and intrinsic motivations rather than organizational policies. While age-inclusive HR practices can foster a supportive environment, they may not directly influence the generative drive of older workers. These findings underscore the complexity of the factors that drive digital knowledge acquisition. They suggest that future research should investigate additional variables, such as self-efficacy or technological experience, to provide a deeper understanding of these relationships.

### *Theoretical contribution*

The findings of this study contribute to the growing body of research on intergenerational knowledge transfer, especially in the context of digital transformation. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of reverse mentoring in fostering knowledge transfer between generations in digital environments (Chaudhuri et al., 2021). This research aligns with these studies by emphasizing the role of older workers seeking digital intelligence knowledge from younger colleagues, yet it adds a novel dimension by integrating temporal social comparison as a key mechanism in this knowledge transfer process.

This study extends existing frameworks by highlighting the role of age-inclusive HR practices in facilitating intergenerational knowledge transfer, especially in the context of digital environments. Previous research has emphasized the importance of intergenerational collaboration for driving innovation in digital settings (Nurhas et al., 2023). However, the findings contribute to this literature by showing how age-inclusive HR practices are crucial in bridging the generational gap and promoting mutual learning between younger and older employees in industries undergoing digital transformation. Previous studies have emphasized the value of formal and informal networks for effective knowledge sharing in digital health and other sectors (Brennecke et al., 2024; Schwaer et al., 2012). These networks are most effective when supported by organized policies that create an inclusive, non-competitive environment for knowledge exchange. Moreover, unlike previous studies that primarily focused on the benefits of reverse mentoring for younger workers (Singh et al., 2021), this study shifts the focus to older employees' active participation in the knowledge transfer process.

These findings make significant contributions to the understanding of intergenerational knowledge transfer in the digital era, offering both theoretical insights and practical recommendations for organizations aiming to integrate older workers into the digital workforce. Future research should explore how these dynamics manifest across different cultural and organizational contexts, building on the foundations laid by previous studies in digital transformation and knowledge management (Annosi et al., 2024).

## *Implications for construction company management*

Knowledge acquisition from the temporal social comparison perspective of older construction workers has different practical implications for construction workers, managers, and organizations. For construction workers, a better understanding of the impact of temporal social comparisons on future status threats and generativity motives can enhance their knowledge exchange interactions with young construction workers. Such reverse mentoring allows older construction workers to adapt to a rapidly evolving work environment, rather than passively avoiding IT work or facing the fate of being eliminated from the organization.

For managers, the time perspective can help them better understand status conflicts (Li et al., 2025), work motivation (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011), and the resulting reverse mentoring between different age groups. For example, construction company managers can threaten the status of older construction workers by giving young construction workers with extensive IT skills higher positions or perks, that will make older construction workers think about how to change the status quo.

Finally, organizations have an ongoing question about maintaining a motivated workforce in which construction workers perform and cooperate at their highest level while refraining from negative behaviors (Reh et al., 2022). Research has established that introducing age-

inclusive HR policies signals to construction workers that their organization is making serious efforts to establish a fair climate for everyone, reducing intergenerational competitiveness and improving the quality of interactions between age-diverse construction workers (Hans *et al.*, 2023; Oteng *et al.*, 2024). In this context, competitive reward systems have become questionable because they augment the undesirable effects of threatening comparisons (Reh *et al.*, 2018). Turning toward cooperative, team-oriented incentive systems may help minimize the experience of status threat (Gläser *et al.*, 2017) and increase generativity motives at work (Kooij and Van De Voorde, 2011).

## Limitations and future directions

This study has several limitations. First, although time-lagged data collection was used, it remains challenging to establish definitive causality from the results. While the study provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed model, future research should utilize a longitudinal design to strengthen the causal inferences of the relationships explored. Second, this study assumes that younger construction workers generally have a lower status than their older counterparts, but this assumption may not hold in some emerging technology sectors, where younger workers may have a higher status due to their digital expertise. Future studies could expand the age range of participants to explore whether similar patterns of temporal social comparison and knowledge acquisition behaviors are present among younger employees or across mixed-age groups. This could help better understand the dynamics of reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer in varied organizational settings. Third, while this study focuses on the Chinese construction industry, the findings have broader implications. The dynamics of reverse intergenerational knowledge transfer and the role of age-inclusive HR practices are relevant to other countries with aging workforces, particularly in industries undergoing digital transformation. Both developed and emerging economies face similar challenges related to technological advancements and the need to upskill older employees (Hans *et al.*, 2023). Future research could explore how these dynamics manifest in other regions with diverse demographic and organizational characteristics, such as in Europe or North America, to confirm the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study did not conduct a heterogeneity analysis to examine differences in knowledge acquisition behaviors across factors such as gender and geographical background. Exploring these factors could offer valuable insights into the diverse experiences of construction workers and help identify potential moderators of the relationships between social comparison, knowledge acquisition, and age-inclusive HR practices. Future research with a more diverse sample could explore these aspects further, adding depth to the understanding of how demographic variables influence knowledge transfer in the context of digital transformation.
