## ABSTRACT

*This chapter aims to elaborate different research methods that can be employed in organizational studies. Since the complex and indivisible relationships between the constructs and nature of the social content about the phenomena can be understood better through qualitative methods, importance of qualitative investigation is mentioned and a detailed explanation of grounded theory data analysis as a qualitative method is provided. Grounded Theory mainly suggests that theory can be discovered in qualitative data. The theory employs a specific method that follows symbolic interactionism in viewing humans as active agents in their own lives who create meaning in the processes of action and interaction. Grounded Theory which deems researchers as active participants in the construction of knowledge leading to generation of theory has been used in organizational research widely. Therefore, the chapter also offers an example of the application of grounded theory by using several extracts from the sample transcripts of interviewees.*

## INTRODUCTION

The selection of a research methodology is crucial since it guides the conduct of the research and affects the quality and the accuracy of research results (Creswell, 2014; He & van de Vijver, 2016; Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2012; Scandura & Williams, 2000). Remenyi et al. (1998) stress the critical role of an appropriate methodology choice in obtaining thorough knowledge about a specific problem. The extant research methods literature provides two major research paradigms: positivism and phenomenol-

ogy (Collis & Hussey, 2013; Robson & McCartan, 2016). The term research paradigm has emerged from Kuhn's (1962) view and has been used "to denote a particular worldview that constitutes a researcher's values, beliefs and methodological assumptions" (O'Neil & Koekemoer, 2016, p. 3).

The assumptions of each paradigm show differences in terms of researchers' ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology (Eriksson & Koalainen, 2008; Howell, 2016). While positivism describes ontology as being objective, phenomenology describes subjective (Hatch & Cunliffe, 2006; Saunders et al., 2012). Typically, positivist research is equated with quantitative research but qualitative research is linked phenomenology paradigm. Therefore, different labels for these paradigms are frequently used in the methodology literature. While rationalist, normative, and quantitative terms are interchangeably used to describe the positivism paradigm, phenomenology is often termed as social constructivism, interpretivism and qualitative research.

Positivists suggest that "exploration can only be based upon observed and captured facts using direct data or information" because of the concrete and external nature of the world (Easterby-Smith et al., 2002, p. 25). However, the phenomenology paradigm posits that "the real world is determined by people rather than by objective and external observable facts" (Easterby-Smith et al., 2002, p. 26). Truth and reality are deemed as social phenomena that do not act independently from social actors. Dynamics of social events along with the human activity make the social world too complex to be explained in simple positivist terms. Obviously, this complex world cannot be explored without discovering all details of social relations, events, situations and the mechanisms behind such situations (Collis & Hussey, 2013; Remenyi et al., 1998).

In the phenomenological paradigm, human activity was concerned with "a collection of symbols expressing layers of meaning" (Maqsood, 2006, p. 93). In a similar line, Blustein et al. (2005) and Willig (2013) state that phenomenological paradigm is especially relevant for the studies where work is embedded in complex layers of social, cultural, and political meanings. Therefore, the phenomena can only be analyzed and understood through "assessing the meanings that participants assign to them" (Rastrick, 2008, p. 54).

Empirical work and theoretical knowledge are often seen as the most interesting, valuable and prestigious part of a scientific study. But lack of theoretical contribution was frequently mentioned by scholars in most of the organizational research (Aytug et al., 2012; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2016). According to Alvesson and Kärreman (2013), "the empirical and theoretical elements are not always engaged in a productive interplay" (p. 2), since the most appropriate methodology that can bridge this gap was not always selected by researchers.

## BACKGROUND

There is still an ongoing argument among the defenders of positivist and phenomenological paradigms about the usability of these research methods. According to positivists, qualitative data do not exist since "everything is distinctively measurable, either 1 or 0, black or white" (Maqsood, 2006, p. 93). However, phenomenology paradigm researchers oppose this view by claiming that "all data are basically qualitative and so they attach meaning to raw experience, words or numbers" (Maqsood, 2006, p. 93). Such arguments have been continuing for a long time in the research methodology literature. Main distinctions between two different research paradigms are outlined in Table 1.

Quantitative methods which emphasize quantification in the collection and data analysis aim to make predictions and explanations that are general to other circumstances and settings (Podsakoff et al., 2016; Kovacic, 2008; Song, 2007). Researchers who prefer employing quantitative methods adopt a nomothetic approach, “thus emphasizing the importance of the deduction of theoretical ideas from earlier knowledge” (Alvesson & Kärreman, 2013, p. 2). Based on rigid sampling, quantitative methods obtain data through questionnaire surveys, on-site observations and secondary data sources and use statistics tools to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions. In quantitative analysis, measurable relationships between identifiable constructs are explored and established hypotheses are tested (Alvesson & Kärreman, 2013; Corbetta, 2003; Scandura & Williams, 2000). Various data collection and analysis approaches that are commonly used in quantitative research are shown in table 2.

In organizational research, qualitative methods that aim to investigate a phenomenon and provide a rich understanding about the issues, actors, and events were frequently used. Nonetheless, the volume of qualitative organizational research being produced is still limited when compared with the amount of quantitative research being conducted (Molina-Azorin, 2012; Podsakoff et al., 2016). Although a growing number of researchers in organizational research and psychology are beginning to use qualitative methods, there is still a scepticism about their validity and reliability among some scholars (Carrera-Fernández, Guárdia-Olmos, & Peró-Cebollero, 2014). Charmaz (2014) states that many social scientists “viewed qualitative research as impressionistic, idiosyncratic, anecdotal, and biased” (p. 1076). However, in order to reveal the complex and indivisible relationships between the constructs and to provide a rich social content about the phenomena, the social actors’ perceptions of the meanings embedded within social settings should have been observed and therefore, the focus on the unfolding process was emphasized (Charmaz, 2014; Scandura & Williams, 2000).

Interpretivism does not aim to falsify or identify a variable, but it focuses on uncovering embedded and perceived meanings as ascribed by the participants. In this sense, truth is viewed as relative and existence of multiple realities is accepted. While keeping its complexity intact, the interpretive research may provide several descriptions of realities. According to the interpretivist method, in order to provide a full understanding about a phenomena, subjective evaluations and interpretations of informants should be carefully analyzed. Creswell (2014) suggests that people who try to investigate their world consciously and/or unconsciously attribute meanings to their experiences.

Moreover, the researcher becomes an active agent in the research process through his or her own perceptions and interpretations (O’Neil & Koekemoer, 2016). Therefore, a research which ignores the perceptions and interpretations of the researcher may not offer sufficient results. Several researchers (e.g., Charmaz, 2014; Madill & Gough, 2008; Yin, 2003) consider qualitative methods more insightful and holistic than quantitative methods. Yin (2003) states that theory building is at the heart of qualitative research (Yin, 2003). Because of the exploratory nature of qualitative research, qualitative findings mostly derive various deeper and unexpected insights.

According to Miles and Huberman (1994), this does not only provide a better understanding of social phenomena, but also “helps in the development and refinement of a hypothesis that can be verified by a positivist approach to develop its significance or cause effect relationship” (Maqsood, 2006, p. 93). Examples of qualitative analysis methods include case study, content analysis, grounded theory, discourse analysis, ethnography, thematic analysis, rapid assessment, task analysis, and action research (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2014). The most well-known qualitative analysis and data collection approaches are depicted in Table 3.

Qualitative methods have long been used in industrial and organizational psychology (I/O) research. The study of Cascio and Aguinis (2008) examined the research activities in the (I/O) literature from 1963 to 2007. Based on the data which included 5,780 articles from top (I/O) journals, content analysis and grounded theory were found among the popular qualitative research methods employed in the area. In fact, qualitative methodologies made significant contributions to the development of (I/O) discipline. Qualitative methods were also employed by eminent psychologists such as Kurt Lewin, Henry Murray, and others (Rogers, 2000).

These historical references show the relevance that qualitative methods have had in the development of the (I/O) field. In addition, especially after late 1990s, qualitative analyses were conducted through sophisticated software as a result of technological breakthroughs (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2014). The establishments of the British Psychological Society (BPS) in 2005 and the Qualitative Research Division

This encourages additional insight, and well as ensuring that subsequent research builds on past endeavors. |

in the American Psychological Association (APA) has supported the use of new qualitative methods in the (I/O) research. The successful applications of qualitative methods, especially within the context of cultural diversity, and their ability to generate hypotheses and their capability to face topics in depth began to be considered valuable (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2014).

Against all developments about the use of qualitative methods in the (I/O) field, a research conducted Kidd (2002) found that only 1.3 percent of the manuscripts accepted by 15 APA journals between 1989 and 1999 employed qualitative methods. No qualitative article was found in five of the analyzed journals (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2014). In a similar type of research, the study of Marchel and Owens (2007) which was based on a subsequent search of 57 journals associated with the APA revealed that out of the 96,379 articles published between 1950 and 2002, only 1,248 were considered qualitative (Carrera-Fernández et al., 2014). The proportion of 1.29 percent verified the findings of the Kidd study.

In a more recent study, Carrera-Fernández et al. (2014) conducted a bibliometric study of research publications to provide updated and valuable results about the use of qualitative analysis methods in the (I/O) field. Through 32 keywords and a database search of the Web of Science (WoS), they found 6,283 publications to analyze. The results showed that the most commonly used methods in the field were content analysis (1827), grounded theory (743), discourse analysis (668), action research (404), and ethnography (308).

Among the qualitative research methods, “grounded theory”, which is a methodology that is grounded in data systematically gathered by multiple sources, was widely used by management and (I/O) researchers (Charmaz, 2014; Howell, 2016). Grounded theory which has been treated “as a neutral, scientific frame of inquiry that researchers can apply anywhere with varied epistemologies” (Charmaz, 2014, p. 1076) has been popular in organization research for three reasons (Jones & Noble, 2007): “it is useful for developing new theory or fresh insights into old theory; it generates theory of direct interest and relevance for practitioners; and it can uncover micro-management processes in complex and unfolding scenarios” (p. 84). Similarly, O’Reilly, Paper and Marx (2012) explain the strength and uniqueness of the approach from an epistemological perspective by mentioning the analytic guidelines that compose the grounded theory: the constant comparative method, theoretical coding, theoretical sampling, theoretical saturation, and theoretical sensitivity.

The theory is “grounded” because it is related to and grounded on the qualitative data collected (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Since grounded theory is not rigidly structured as some positivistic paradigms (Glaser, 1992), it allows researchers adopt inductive development and modification of theory through qualitative analysis. This chapter aims to provide a detailed explanation about how grounded theory is used in organizational research. The chapter also offers an example of the application of the grounded theory process that includes data coding, category grouping and labeling by using several extracts from the sample transcripts of interviewees.

## GROUNDING THEORY APPROACH

Since the late 1980s, grounded theory has become the dominant qualitative approach in many disciplines including management and (I/O). Grounded theory, which is a structured approach to forming and eliciting theory grounded in data, was first presented by two sociologists, Barney G. Glaser and Anselm L. Strauss in 1967 when they were researching in the field of “healthcare and nursing” (Walsh et al., 2015). In the 1960s and 1970s, the research climate of the time “had the unfortunate consequence of discrediting the generation of theory through flexible qualitative and quantitative research” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 223). The approach mainly advocates that theory should just emerge by itself from the data rather than being discovered somewhere else. Because grounded theory can provide efficient means of generating theory that elicits the present situation as it occurs “out there” in reality, it generally becomes a natural choice for the social scientists.

However, although the method enables a researcher to move to empirical generalization through the data, it cannot be entered to the field completely free from previous literature and ideas but the role of literature in grounded theory is still arguable (Heath & Cowley, 2004; O’Reilly et al., 2012). Several researchers (e.g., Creswell, 2014; Saunders et al., 2012) suggest that if the phenomena being investigated has a rigorously established theoretical background, researchers have no luxury of omitting the extant literature completely. Walsh et al. (2015) highlight that “the term grounded theory itself leads to misunderstanding” (p. 582).

Grounded theory does not only describe a research process, but also provides the end result which is empirically grounded in data. Identification of a “core” category (or categories) that emerges from the qualitative data to explain the main concern is the focal point of the method (Charmaz, 2014). Another controversial issue in grounded theory is about the presence of the researcher in processing data and in developing theory (Jones & Noble, 2007; Walsh et al., 2015). After several years from the emergence

of grounded theory, Glaser and Strauss adopted different approaches for the distance of a researcher to theory development process (Conlon et al., 2015; Jones & Noble, 2007).

In this context, while Glaser has been more conservative than Strauss with the idea that nothing should be forced or preconceived by researchers in theorizing, Strauss designated an interactive and provocative role to researchers for theory development through logical elaboration, and preconceived tools and techniques (Charmaz & Belgrave, 2012; Conlon et al., 2015; Jones & Noble, 2007). Therefore, the approaches of researchers were termed as classical (Glasierian) and constructivist (Straussian) grounded theories in the literature. According to Conlon et al. (2015), “grounded theories are products of emergent processes that occur through interaction, constructed by researchers from the fabric of interactions, both witnessed and lived” (p. 40).

### The Role of Theory in the Grounded Approach

In theory development through grounded approach, while Glaser (1992) argues that a researcher should adopt the research problem with almost no prior models and previous literature in mind, Strauss and Corbin (1998) suggest that past experiences, understandings, and existing literature should be used in developing theory to stimulate theoretical sensitivity. They also claim that inductive aspects which may cause to extremely subjective research findings should not be overplayed. According to Creswell (2014), the ideal starting point in building new theory is to omit all preconceptions emerging from existing literature, but this is impractical and misleading. In fact, starting from the early years of the method, researchers (e.g., Atkinson, Coffey, & Delamont, 2003; Bryant, 2009; Martin & Turner, 1986) urged that preconceptions could not be completely abandoned, though they indicated that the researcher should approach the data with an open mind. Conlon et al. (2015) highlight that theory development “involving existing literature, abstract conceptualization from data, and considering all possible explanations to get to the most plausible explanation, critically brings theoretical sensitivity into the process” (p. 40).

In a similar line, Creswell (2014), Eisenhardt (1989), and Saunders et al. (2012) concur that unless the field of research is truly novel, existing literature should be considered and incorporated with current research to guide the formation of research questions and ensure that the research is valuable to the field. Lin (2007), stating that failure to refer to relevant literature reduces confidence in findings, suggests the literature comparison helps the researcher to find “similarities, differences and reasons behind any new hypothesis and has the overall effect of increasing both the quality and validity of findings” (p. 132). Therefore, if the researcher aims to further investigate an issue that has a strong theoretical base by grounded approach, the previous literature cannot be ignored completely in theory development.

In such a process, the emerging theory would be shaped by the combination of the raw data collected and the existing literature as another source of data as the theory starts to form. Besides, the process would enable the researcher to compare “the emerging theory with concepts already present in the literature and help identify concepts and categories of the structure of resultant theory” (Rastrick, 2008, p. 68). However, while developing theory, the researcher should be meticulous in using the current literature and sensitive to possibilities of changing theories so that theorizing becomes based on the data completely. In the process, extreme induction may be avoided with the concern that it may deprive researcher of useful theoretical viewpoints and concepts that can help guide further exploration of the phenomenon. Apart from the role of prior research, the procedure of analyzing the complex data to build theory in grounded approach is shown in the following sections.

### The Procedure of Analyzing Raw Data

The analysis of raw data collected from multiple sources is the vital process in grounded theory approach. The coding and analyzing procedures are explained through real data obtained from sample interview transcripts below.

### Data Coding

The main purpose of data coding is to reduce, organize, and compare the large amount of data collected (Creswell, 2014; O'Reilly et al., 2012). In our sample, the data were collected through interviews. Therefore, the data coding stage which includes a line by line analysis of the different scripts generated from the interviews began by discovering and identifying the central concepts and their properties. Central concepts are the ideas and the building blocks of a theory which expose the thoughts and meanings about the phenomenon that are represented through the data (Kovacic, 2008). Data collection process may yield a large amount of data that can lead to the danger of drowning in data. For this reason, the researcher should follow a systematic coding process that breaks the huge amount of data down into smaller sections (Saunders et al., 2012; Strauss & Corbin, 1998).

Hence, after a detailed examination and comparison for similarities and differences in the scripts based on the words, phrases, meanings, sentences or whole paragraphs that can provide connections to the research objectives and questions, the complete raw data should be set down into manageable parts and an initial code should be assigned to each central concept (O'Reilly et al., 2012; Strauss & Corbin, 1998).

#### Initial Data Coding

Although the raw data can be analyzed in a line by line style, in order to overcome the time-consuming effects of the method and to possess a more complete and precise story about the phenomena, the sentences, paragraphs, and the entire document should be analyzed in a more holistic manner (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Therefore, the transcripts should be first revised in a holistic way by taking notes in the margins of the pages instead of just focusing on the frequency of the words and checking the relationships of the words and sentences with the potential phenomena, central concepts and categories (Fendt & Sachs, 2008; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). The first holistic revision of the data enables the researcher to investigate the central concepts and assign an initial code to each central concept. The central concepts should be selected and identified based on their connections to the research objectives and questions, the criteria for choosing a central category offered by Strauss and Corbin (1998) are shown in Table 4.

In our research, the initial coding phase yielded three central resource categories which were consistent with the previous resource-based view (RBV) literature: tangible resources, intangible resources and capabilities. In identifying the central resource categories, the previous resource-based literature was also considered. In the transcripts, all mentioned resources (e.g., such as cash, financial investments, raised financial capital, production equipment, raw materials, manufacturing facilities, machinery, physical buildings, real estate, land etc.) that can be observed, touched, and quantified by accounting standards were deemed as tangible resources (Barney & Hesterly, 2010; Galbreath & Galvin, 2006). Hence, as an initial code, *TR* was assigned for the tangible resources mentioned in the study.

Similarly, considering the resource-based theory (Boyd, Bergh, & Ketchen, 2010; Molloy et al., 2011; Norman, Butler, & Ranft, 2013; Wang et al., 2016) resources that are intangible in nature (e.g., copyrights,

| 1 | It must be central; that is, all other major categories can be related to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2 | It must appear frequently in the data. This means that within all or almost all cases, there are indicators pointing to that concept.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3 | The explanation that evolves by relating the categories is logical and consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4 | The name or phrase used to describe the central category should be sufficiently abstract that it can be used to do research in other substantive areas, leading to the development of a more general theory.                                                                                                                             |
| 5 | As the concept is refined analytically through integration with other concepts, the theory grows in depth and explanatory power.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6 | The concept is able to explain variation as well as the main point made by the data; that is, when conditions vary, the explanation still holds, although the way in which a phenomenon is expressed might look somewhat different. One also should be able to explain contradictory or alternative cases in terms of that central idea. |

registered designs, patents, organizational culture, brand name reputation, corporate image, strategic partnerships) were detected in the scripts and the initial code *IR* was assigned to the central intangible resources category. In order to detect the capabilities mentioned in the interviews, the researcher focused on the skills which possess the ability of turning static resources into competitive advantage that were mentioned in the qualitative data especially with the help of existing RBV literature (Helfat & Martin, 2015; Leiblein, 2011; Maritan & Peteraf, 2011).

In the scripts, the respondents especially mentioned the important roles of human resource (both for the employees and managers) quality, relationships built and maintained with customers, suppliers and distributors, and the systems which refer to the business processes (e.g., IT and supply chain systems) to create new configurations of resources. Moreover, the significance of revealing the tacit knowledge, advantages obtained from networking abilities, and possessing organizational routines were frequently emphasized as the key mechanisms to achieve congruence between the firms' resources and dynamic environmental conditions in the interviews. Therefore, as an initial code, *CAP* was assigned for the aforementioned capabilities in this research.

An example of the coding process along with the other stages of grounded theory is provided below. An extract from a transcript of an interviewee which is a representative of other transcripts is used. Although the sample is a brief extract and it does not highlight all of the phenomena, it is an appropriate representative of the process used throughout the data analysis.

#### Transcript Extract

The first step is undertaken to identify the phenomena and to examine the text through looking at events, objects, actions, or interactions that are considered relevant to the research. Phenomena are identified in the below transcript extract and are numbered and marked in bold.

##### Sample #1

Interview date: 10.04.2012 (Kamasak, 2014)

Erm, then the senior team that was formed to help outsider consultants made a conclusion that (1) they wanted to be able to realize this change, and as a result of that, (2) from top to bottom, (3) our staff showed a keen interest for achieving this. And then a (4) lot of collaboration across functionality between headquarters, branches, and other departments occurred (5) to end this in the best manner.

Indeed, it was a difficult and (6) long period of time whilst (7) members of the whole organization collaborated on it. The fact that (8) everyone focused on the target and decided to do stuff in line with the requirements of the project, we needed to (9) figure out the most efficient way of doing it. And the reason it took so long, actually it is not finished yet, is because of having that (10) effective and excited conversation which took place among our staff in the (11) different branches who were saying we want to do this way and the consultants saying well, are you sure that makes sense that is a kind of issue needs serious remediation. However, although we were expecting to have at least modest resistance from our employees, (12) they have been so willing and supportive during the process. This situation really impressed me and made me think that the bank created some kind of a (13) change management capability with (14) the help of corporate culture. We always (15) respected to our employees and concerned them as a real source for sustaining competitive advantage since the establishment of the bank. Besides, we have (16) encouraged them (17) to develop their personal and technical skills, and (18) made them feel as our partners rather than employees. For this reason, we always (19) refrained adapting a strict hierarchical structure to the bank. I believe we are getting our (20) human resources investments worth now.

##### Sample #2

Interview date: 29.03.2012 (Kamasak, 2014)

Probably the (21) brand name has the priority mostly in minds' of the customers. In fact, we thought that (22) the patents and licenses might have a little bit more importance for the firm, but what we think may not be same with what our customers think and (23) they are (customers) always right. However, (24) brand and patent are really attached to each other. Those are the things to be considered for a real valuation of a firm apart from (25) cash flow statements and equipment. (26) Ownership of well-known brands is extremely important in our (food) business where hygiene and (27) product reliability issues cause maximum concern on customers. A recent marketing research study indicated Ulker as the second (28) most recognized brand in Turkey, in all categories.

##### Sample #3

Interview date: 30.05.2012 (Kamasak, 2014)

(29) Human capital is a big deal in this business. This business, just like I think most all businesses that must produce (30) special services and sell directly to their customers, (31) the human piece of this is a big intangible resources. For this reason, we need to understand the (32) dedication and talent of our people and utilize from them as much as we can. We have several consultants who are just (33) extremely talented people that do (34) high quality job of (35) understanding the needs of the customers and (36) offering different sophisticated solutions. This is the rule of the game, competition is fierce in every industry and you are on the stage as long as you can differentiate yourself from others. In this context, our (37) organizational culture dictates to us excellence in delivering what we promise and adding value beyond the expectations and we believe that (38) excellence can only be achieved through innovation, agility and skilled people who are open to learning. (39) Recruiting enough good people is a big challenge for us because there are simply not enough new skilled graduates at our standards. Therefore, apart from attracting (40) talented people by using our (41) corporate reputation and offering a high standard of life for the future to work and stay with us, (42) we have to

**provide our people the opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed** on their own terms as well. Having **(43) the best consultants is the only way** of keeping and retaining **(44) our customers whose relationships trace back** to 10 to 15 years.

The next stage of the coding process includes grouping similar phenomena and re-labelling them as concepts. The number shown in brackets names relate to the phenomena numbered in the previous step.

(A) Core values, shared vision and attitudes (1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 14, 37)

(U) Strong corporate reputation (41)  
(V) Openness to learning (42)  
(W) Relationships established with customers (44)

This initial data coding procedure provided some benefits to the researcher. First, data analysis process became much easier. Second, it enabled the researcher to assess the main central resource categories which were used to define the sub-categories of these resources that led to the organization of the resources and capabilities in a coherent manner.

#### Second Level Data Coding

In the second level data coding, the identified central resource categories were divided into sub-categories in order to have a clearer picture and better understanding about the interactions and links between different resources and capabilities. Sub-resource categories were generated by the detailed line by line analysis of the holistic central resource concepts and categories along with the review of current

resource-based literature. In the last stage of coding, concepts that were found to be conceptually similar or related are then termed categories (Figure 1). The letters shown in brackets related to the concepts presented in the previous step.

Therefore, the proposed conceptual model of the resource pool identifies the key resources and capabilities which demonstrate contribution to firm success. Obviously, this model does not capture all the resources mentioned in the literature or the ones that may bear in mind of a researcher. Although every resource or capability can be necessary to execute a specified market strategy, the RBV theorizes that the relative contribution of each resource differs and the resources which play the major role in the attainment of the firm success are strategic in nature (Barney & Hesterly, 2010; Maritan & Peteraf, 2011). Therefore, the identification and categorization of the resource and capability constructs based on the relevant literature and interview data has been a considerable challenge for the researcher.

## FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

Resources are organizational in origin and complex, and neither their identification nor their role in creating performance can be assessed easily. Obviously, understanding of complex nature of resources that are embedded in organizations designates the need for fieldwork based qualitative methods like grounded theory. The importance of grounded theory in developing a conceptual resource list and understanding the managerial and organizational processes through which the resources become valuable is emphasized in the organizational literature (Molina-Azorin, 2012).

Nevertheless, while investigating the complex interactions between constructs through qualitative studies, the necessity of quantitative methodology for the law-like generalization and validation of a powerful and stringent theory should not be ignored. Although the grounded theory approach was frequently used by researchers to examine the complex relationships between different constructs and the approach was elaborated with all details, each single research method has some limitations and grounded theory approach is not an exception.

Therefore, alternative methods including a combination of different approaches that capture data for construct development and measurement along with empirical testing are required (Harrigan, 2009; Saunders et al., 2012). One approach is the use of mixed-methodology including quantitative and qualitative methods together.

Mixed-methods research is found in the management and (I/O) literature, but it is rarely used (Harrigan, 2009; Molina-Azorin, 2012). In his specific study, Molina-Azorin (2009) found only 30 research articles using mixed-methods that have been published in all the issues of *Strategic Management Journal* between 1984 and 2006. As an illustrative example of mixed-methods research, Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) conducted a two-phase qualitative – quantitative (QUAL → QUAN) sequential research design in the Canadian oil and gas industry which aims to ground the RBV of the firm within the domain of corporate environmental responsiveness.

In the first phase (exploratory), the linkages between environmental strategies and the development of capabilities along with the nature of any emergent capabilities and their competitive outcomes were examined through in-depth interviews in seven firms in the Canadian oil and gas industry. The first phase ended with a qualitative content analysis and two hypotheses based on previous literature and the findings of qualitative study. In the second phase (confirmatory), the relationship between emergent linkages and competitive outcomes was empirically tested through a mail survey-based study. While the qualitative

**Tangible Resources (TR)** are composed of:

- I. Cash (M) → Physical Assets
- II. Equipment (N) → Financial Assets

**Intangible Resources (IR)** are composed of:

- III. Organizational culture (A, B, D, E, G, J, V) → Organizational Assets
- IV. Organizational policies (H) → Organizational Assets
- V. Organizational structure (I) → Organizational Assets

- VIII. Quality perception (O) → Reputational Assets
- IX. Copyrights (L) → Intellectual Property Assets
- X. In-secret technology/service (P) → Intellectual Property Assets

**Capabilities (CAP)** are composed of:

- XI. Human capital (C, F, J) → Human Capital
- XII. Skilled and qualified employees (Q) → Human Capital
- XIII. Innovativeness (S) → Human Capital
- XIV. Creativity (T) → Human Capital
- XV. Knowledge and information sharing (R) → Knowledge Management Skills
- XVI. Relationships established with customers (W) → Networking capabilities

phase helps to get to know the industry and develop theory, hypotheses and the measurement instrument, the quantitative phase empirically examines the relationships for generalization and verification purposes.

In another study, which examines the role of network knowledge resources in influencing firm performance in the American automotive supplier industry, Dyer and Hatch (2006) employed a mixed-methods research that consists of a quantitative – qualitative (QUAN → QUAL) sequential design. In the first phase of the study, the relationship between customer-to-supplier knowledge-sharing activities and the rate of improvement in supplier network performance was empirically examined by the quantitative part. Based on the empirical findings, a total of 13 interviews (in the qualitative part) were conducted to explore why the supplier performs better as a member of one network (i.e., Toyota's) than another network (i.e., GM, Ford, or Chrysler) in the second phase.

As a future research direction, another study may employ a research design that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative approaches that could identify key resource sets of firms, explore how these resources are converted into positions of advantage by managers, and test their effects on firm performance empirically.

## CONCLUSION

Different methodological perspectives that can be used in organizational research were summarized in this chapter and the grounded theory approach as a qualitative research method was covered. Indeed, the aim of this chapter was not to increase the popularity of a single research method, but rather to provide some practical information useful for researchers. It should be noted that selection of the appropriate methodology must be consistent with the research objectives. This appropriate methodology may be qualitative, quantitative, or a mixed-method. In order to resolve the ongoing debate on the supremacy of one method over another one, different methods can be employed through an approach of “triangulation” which refers to the combination of several research methods to study the same phenomenon. Therefore, the weaknesses, problems and intrinsic biases that may emerge from a single method or a single theory research can be overcome and the validity and reliability of the findings can be increased through convergence of different perspectives.

## KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

**Barney G. Glaser and Anslem L. Strauss:** Sociologists who offered a general model for constructing new theory called grounded theory.

**Data Coding and Analysis:** The process of combining the data for themes, ideas and categories and inspecting them to discover useful information.

**Emergent Reconstruction:** Emergent processes that occur through interaction, constructed by researchers from the fabric of interactions, both witnessed and lived.

**Grounded Theory:** A structured approach to forming and eliciting theory grounded in data.

**Interviewing:** A face-to-face interaction with someone to have accurate information about something.

**Qualitative Research Methods:** Research methods in which the researcher trusts textual data more than numerical data and analyzes this data in its textual form instead of transforming it into numbers for analysis, with the objective of understanding the meaning of human action.

**Research Methodology:** The process of collecting information and data and analysing the data for the purpose of scientific inquiry.

**Theory Building:** The process of building a statement of concepts and their interrelationships that shows how and/or why a phenomenon occurs.
