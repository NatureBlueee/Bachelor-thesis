## Each generation brings values, attitudes, and beliefs that shape what makes them happy in the workplace.

Projected to make up [74% of the global workforce by 2030](#), Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2006) and millennials (born between 1983 and 1994) are a defining force. It is important for businesses to understand what matters to these generations. Deloitte Global's Gen Z and Millennial Survey, now in its 14th year, examines the factors shaping the worldviews of 23,482 Gen Z and millennial respondents across 44 countries. The results reveal a cohort of professionals who are rejecting traditional rules and antiquated structures in their pursuit of career satisfaction—and ultimately, happiness.

Gen Zs and millennials are ambitious. But for them, success is not necessarily about climbing the corporate ladder. In fact, many are not motivated by reaching senior leadership positions, revealing a potential leadership pipeline problem for the future.

Learning and development is a priority, and they expect their employers to provide these opportunities. Some have foregone higher education to pursue the practical skills that trade or vocational training provides. And as technology transforms the world of work, Gen Zs and millennials are enhancing their knowledge and embracing new tools, such as GenAI.

These generations are seeking more than just a job. Making money is important but so is finding meaningful work and well-being. They are looking for careers with the right balance of these factors, a “trifecta” that can be hard to find.

They have high expectations for their employers, and they often job hop to meet their career ambitions in a world where the [social contract between employers and employees has eroded](#). Many feel their managers are not meeting their needs. Some believe that companies are not doing enough to address workplace stress. And most are feeling the pressures of the cost of living.

The findings demonstrate the need for organizations, senior leaders, and managers to create environments where workers can not only attain the trifecta of meaningful work, financial security, and well-being, but also achieve the professional growth they are looking for. By supporting these pillars consistently, organizations can uphold the social contract and create a cycle of satisfaction, engagement, and success.

### Among this year's key findings:

### Gen Zs and millennials are focused on learning, but feel their managers are missing the mark on key aspects of their development

Gen Zs are more focused on work/life balance than climbing to the top of the corporate ladder—only 6% say their primary career goal is to reach a leadership position. But they don't lack ambition. When asked the strongest reasons they chose to work for their current employer, learning and development is in the top three, just behind work/life balance and opportunities to progress in their careers. Seven in 10 Gen Zs say they are developing skills to advance their careers once a week or more, compared to 59% of millennials who say the same. Both Gen Zs and millennials are aligned on the skills they feel are important to progress in their careers (soft skills, time management, and industry-specific knowledge). There is also a sense among both generations that their managers are missing the mark. They believe managers' key role is to provide guidance and support, to inspire and motivate them, to offer mentorship, and to help them set boundaries to ensure work/life balance. Instead, many feel that their managers are mostly focused on closely overseeing day-to-day tasks.

### Concerned about its return on investment, some are foregoing higher education

Some Gen Zs and millennials seem to be reexamining how the education system prepares them for the job market. Although a university or college degree remains valuable, the traditional university to career path is not necessarily the default anymore, as nearly one-third of Gen Zs (31%) and millennials (32%) in this year's report say they decided not to pursue higher education. Forty percent of Gen Zs and 38% of millennials said the high cost of tuition was their primary concern. But their responses also reveal a skepticism about the return on investment of higher education with many Gen Zs and millennials questioning if the education provided at universities would give them enough practical experience to prepare them for the job market.

### Soft skills are vital as GenAI transforms the way Gen Zs and millennials work

Most Gen Zs (57%) and millennials (56%) are already using GenAI in their day-to-day work for a variety of tasks: data analysis, creative work, content creation, project management, strategy creation, risk assessments, and more. They are largely positive about the technology, saying that it helps them improve the quality of their work, and frees up time to focus on more strategic work while improving their work/life balance. But they also have significant concerns: They worry it will reduce available jobs and make it harder for young people to enter the workforce in the future. They are focused on training and skills development to prepare them to work alongside GenAI. And as they continue developing their technical skills, they also believe that developing soft skills, such as empathy and leadership, is more important than ever.

## Money, meaning, and well-being intersect to form the foundation for happiness at work

Career fluidity is a defining feature of the modern workforce: Nearly one-third (31%) of Gen Zs plan to switch employers in the next two years. And while millennials may be more settled into their careers, 17% still say they plan to leave their employer within two years. Their job hopping isn't driven by a lack of loyalty. Many Gen Zs and millennials see it as a strategy to seek stability, better work/life balance, a greater sense of purpose, and an opportunity to learn and acquire new skills. When asked about their career goals and the factors that cause them to change careers and/or employers, their answers can be boiled down to three key areas: money, meaning, and well-being. Balancing these three things sets the foundation for overall happiness among Gen Zs and millennials. And for employers, it may hold the key to attracting talent, reducing turnover, and increasing engagement.

### There is a rising sense of financial insecurity among Gen Zs and millennials

For the fourth year in a row, the cost of living tops the list of concerns for Gen Zs and millennials. And there is a rising sense of financial insecurity—nearly half of Gen Zs (48%) and millennials (46%) say they don't feel financially secure and more than half of both generations live paycheck to paycheck. These concerns are taking a toll: Only 36% of Gen Zs and 39% of millennials with cost-of-living concerns say they felt happy over the past year. And eight in 10 say their long-term financial future and their day-to-day finances contribute to their stress levels.

### Gen Zs and millennials want purpose-driven work, or the resources to drive change outside of work

Purpose influences motivation, engagement, and according to 89% of Gen Zs and 92% of millennials, it is important to job satisfaction and well-being. Many Gen Zs and millennials want to find meaning in their careers and often seek out work that allows them to derive a broader sense of purpose. When evaluating a potential employer, more than half of Gen Zs (54%) and millennials (53%) say meaningful work is very important. For those who don't feel they are making a meaningful contribution to society through their work, some are focused on making money and having a good work/life balance so that they can use their time and resources to make a difference outside of work.

### Supporting the mental well-being of workers should start with addressing the root causes of workplace stress

Gen Zs and millennials who say their leaders support their mental health, who have opportunities to grow within their organizations, and who are satisfied with their work/life balance are more likely to say they have positive well-being, and by extension are more likely to report higher levels of happiness. Yet, only 52% of Gen Zs and 58% of millennials rate their mental well-being as good or very good. And 40% of Gen Zs and 34% of millennials say they feel stressed or anxious all or most of the time—among them, about one-third say their job is a major source of stress. Long working hours, lack of recognition, and toxic workplaces are driving their stress levels. Gen Zs and millennials feel their managers could do more to address the root causes of stress in the workplace.

## Environmental concerns continue to influence Gen Z and millennial behavior

The environment is a major source of anxiety for these generations, with two-thirds (65% of Gen Zs and 63% of millennials) saying they have felt worried or anxious about the environment in the past month. Their environmental concerns influence their consumer behavior. For example, nearly two-thirds of Gen Zs (65%) and millennials (63%) say they are willing to pay more for environmentally sustainable products or services. Environmental concerns also impact their career decisions—two out of 10 Gen Zs (23%) and millennials (22%) say they have researched a company's environmental impact or policies before accepting a job from them.

## 1 | Learning and development and the leadership gap

{6}------------------------------------------------

With the emergence of viral trends such as “[quiet quitting](#)”, “[bare minimum Mondays](#)”, and “[productivity theater](#)”, Gen Zs have gained a reputation for not putting in effort at work. A recent survey found that [three in four managers and business leaders say Gen Z is the most challenging generation to work with](#) due to their perceived lack of technical skills, motivation, and effort. Millennials faced similar criticism earlier in their careers, often deemed “[entitled](#)” and “[disengaged](#)” by older generations.

Intergenerational tensions in the workforce likely stem from the very different environments in which each generation started their careers and how this shaped their perspectives and expectations.

Older millennials started their careers during the 2008 financial crisis which led to high unemployment, limited opportunities for career progression, and stagnant wages. Alternately seen as the [burnout](#) or the [resilient](#) generation, millennials worked more hours for less pay and less security, struggling to achieve the same standards of living as their parents. Many reacted by rejecting the status quo, namely seeking more purpose-driven work and new work patterns such as remote work.

Subsequently, many Gen Zs started their careers during a global pandemic, which, among other impacts, resulted in widespread reflection on the role work should play in a person's life and ultimately a deeper focus on work/life balance.

### Career ambitions

Gen Zs' focus on work/life balance may give them [doubts about climbing to the top of the corporate ladder](#)—only 6% of Gen Zs said their primary career goal is to reach a leadership position. But this doesn't mean they lack ambition. They are, in fact, very focused on learning and growing. When asked the strongest reasons they chose to work for their current employer, learning and development is in the top three, just behind good work/life balance and opportunities to progress in their careers. And 70% of Gen Zs say they are developing skills to advance their careers once a week or more, compared to 59% of millennials who say the same. While nearly one-third (30%) are learning new skills during work, about two-thirds of Gen Zs (67%) are developing skills outside of working hours, either before or after work, or on their days off.

### Expectations versus reality

In terms of the skills and capabilities they feel are most important to their career progression, and how they want to be supported, Gen Zs and millennials are aligned. They say soft skills (like communication, leadership, empathy, and networking), time management, and industry-specific knowledge are most important. And to develop these skills and capabilities, they want mentorship and guidance (86% of Gen Zs and 84% of millennials) and on-the-job learning and practical experience (89% of both generations).

*"I've had managers who were solely focused on task completion without fostering any growth or innovation... my current leaders want us to try new things, take risks, and pursue learning opportunities, even if it means spending time away from our regular job duties. This supportive environment has been a game-changer for my professional development."*

Gen Z, Male

Managers should be in a position to provide or facilitate these things, but Gen Zs and millennials feel there is a wide gap between what they expect of their managers and what they are actually experiencing. They want managers to provide guidance and support, to inspire and motivate them, to offer mentorship, and to help them set boundaries to ensure work/life balance. Instead, most feel that their managers are more focused on closely overseeing day-to-day tasks.

Many managers see this gap themselves—according to the latest Deloitte US [Global Human Capital Trends](#) report, managers spend nearly 40% of their time solving immediate problems and focusing on administrative tasks, with only 13% of their time spent developing the people who work for them. And the same report finds that over one-third (36%) of managers are not sufficiently prepared to be people managers, suggesting that more learning and development is needed across each stage of a person's career.

### Supporting better learning and development

Tactics that Gen Zs and millennials believe their employers could use to better support their learning needs include: creating dedicated in-house learning programs and allotting time to conduct learning without interfering with workloads and responsibilities, offering financial compensation for external learning opportunities, providing 1:1 mentorship opportunities with experts, and offering access to learning platforms and subscriptions. Some feel that more opportunities for job rotation or job shadowing would also help them learn.

### Takeaways for business leaders

To meet the needs of today's workforce, businesses should cultivate a culture of learning and development which starts right from the beginning of their employees' careers and continues as they progress. Learning and development should be a continuous process of investing in growth at each stage. It requires consistently evaluating what skills and capabilities workers should develop, how to provide the right learning opportunities, and how to ensure that people feel comfortable taking time away from their busy workloads to engage in learning and development. By making learning a priority, organizations can enable the opportunities for growth and lifelong development that Gen Zs and millennials have come to expect in the workplace.

One area that the survey findings clearly point to is a need for better leadership training to help ensure that managers are prepared for the people-leadership aspect of their jobs. Business leaders should consider the role managers play in driving **workforce success**. As workers are being asked to learn new skills and ways of working, adapt to new technologies, and pivot in response to unexpected change, organizations should empower managers, who are uniquely situated to redesign work and help their people navigate change in the face of increasing complexity.

## 2 | Rereexamining the value of higher education

{12}------------------------------------------------

It's clear that Gen Zs and millennials value the opportunity for continuous learning and development at work, but some seem to be reexamining how the education system prepares them for the job market. Although a university or college degree remains valuable, the traditional university to career path is not necessarily the default anymore, as nearly one-third of Gen Zs (31%) and millennials (32%) in this year's survey say they decided not to pursue higher education. Some are instead opting to explore alternative paths, such as vocational qualifications, apprenticeships, or trades that may offer more skills-based learning and lower financial burden.

### Factors influencing higher education decisions

Within these cohorts, financial constraints and evolving priorities are pushing some away from higher education. Nearly 40% of Gen Zs and millennials who decided not to pursue higher education cited financial constraints as one of the primary driving factors. For 34% of Gen Zs and 42% of millennials, family or personal circumstances also affected their decision. Beyond money and personal considerations, some felt that higher education wasn't the right path for them. For example, roughly a quarter said they were looking for flexibility and the opportunity to learn on their own terms (26% of Gen Zs and 22% of millennials), or were seeking career paths that don't require a university or college degree, such as vocational training, apprenticeships, or trades (25% of Gen Zs and 22% of millennials). Around 20% in both cohorts said they chose not to attend university because they were not interested in traditional education.

Q. What are the primary reasons influencing your decision to not pursue higher education?

\*Question only asked to those who did not attend college or university

{13}------------------------------------------------

When asked about their concerns with the current higher education system, 40% of Gen Zs and 38% of millennials said the high cost of tuition was their primary concern. But their responses also reveal a skepticism about the return on investment of higher education with many Gen Zs and millennials questioning if the education provided at universities would give them enough practical experience to prepare for the job market. More than one-third of Gen Zs (35%) and millennials (37%) said they were concerned about the quality of the education provided. One quarter said they were concerned about the relevance of the curriculum to the job market (24% of Gen Zs and 25% of millennials). And 28% of Gen Zs and 27% of millennials said they were concerned that higher education offered limited practical experience.

### Perceptions and outcomes

Ultimately, many Gen Zs (49%) and millennials (47%) who pursued higher education feel they made the right choice and would make the same decision again. Another roughly four in 10 (41% of Gen Zs and 42% of millennials) say that while they believe they made the right decision, they might consider pursuing a different path if given the chance to do it over again. For those who decided to pursue a trade or vocational training, the results are more mixed: fewer Gen Zs (39%) and millennials (36%) feel they made the right choice and that they'd make the same decision again, while almost half say that they feel they made the right decision but would consider a different path if given the chance. One in 10 (10% of Gen Zs and 12% of millennials) say they regret their decision and wish they had gone to a university instead.

For many, higher education still seems to pay off, correlating with higher levels of financial security: 55% of Gen Zs and 57% of millennials with a university degree or higher feel financially secure compared with 44% of Gen Zs and 41% of millennials who obtained a trade or vocational qualification, and 40% of Gen Zs and 34% of millennials who ended their education after high school. Respondents with a college or university degree are also more confident that they'll be able to retire comfortably and are less likely to live paycheck to paycheck.

Outside of financial outcomes, this year's results show that many aspects of job satisfaction aren't tied to education level. Gen Zs and millennials who did not pursue higher education are just as satisfied with their opportunities to progress and to learn and develop new skills at work as those with higher education levels. There is also little difference in their satisfaction with work/life balance and their job security/stability.

### Takeaways for business leaders

Gen Zs and millennials have been rethinking higher education and the best paths to prepare them for their careers, and it's likely this trend will continue for younger generations given how quickly technology is changing industries and the way people work. In addition to education and gaining the right *skills* for the job market, *gaining experience* can be a challenge. Many people entering the workforce are *struggling to find foothold* jobs where they can learn, a problem exacerbated by the fact that AI is shrinking traditional entry-level roles. In turn, some employers are having trouble *finding talent with the necessary experience*. With this in mind, business leaders can consider a few strategies. First, they can examine their process and requirements for recruiting to ensure they aren't missing good candidates. This may include removing degree requirements for certain positions or developing apprenticeship programs which attract candidates who are looking for an alternative to university or a path to meet the experience requirements for entry level jobs. Secondly, business leaders can consider partnering with universities to form programs which give students the hands-on practical experience they seek to prepare them for their careers. These efforts can help organizations attract new talent, while building a pipeline of well-prepared candidates.

"Currently, I'm at a manager level, but I'm aiming to have direct reports soon. Looking five to ten years ahead, I want to be in a strategic thinking role, which is why I went back to get my MBA. My MBA provided me with leadership and critical thinking skills that are essential for moving up to director or VP roles. It has prepared me to influence people and work closely with senior leadership."

## 3 | Embracing the promise of GenAI

{17}------------------------------------------------

Throughout history, the emergence of new technology has brought waves of excitement alongside fear and resistance to change. Transformational technologies disrupt the status quo, often leading to short-term challenges as society adjusts to keep pace. These two generations have seen a flood of technological advances in their lifetimes, none more potentially impactful than GenAI. Similar to the advent of the internet, GenAI is the type of technology that will alter the way we work in enormous ways. As the [Deloitte US 2025 Tech Trends](#) report states, "AI is being woven into the fabric of our lives. We'll eventually think of AI in the same way that we think of HTTP or electricity. We won't proactively use it; we'll simply experience a world in which it makes everything work smarter, faster, and more intuitively."

*"My biggest concern about the impact of GenAI on society and the workforce is job displacement. In addition, there is a risk that the economic gap will widen, as those who control these technologies will reap greater benefits, while displaced workers will face challenges in accessing new jobs in technological or specialized sectors."*

### GenAI adoption and use cases

Most Gen Zs (57%) and millennials (56%) are already using GenAI in their day-to-day work to some extent. And among them, about 30% of Gen Zs and millennials say they use it all or most of the time, up from 26% of Gen Zs and 22% of millennials in 2024. Although adoption is growing, a sizeable minority of the workforce still does not engage with GenAI tools—26% of Gen Zs and 27% of millennials say they never use GenAI at work, which could be attributed to a lack of necessity, skills, or company implementation. Still, most recognize this will change soon—three quarters of Gen Zs (74%) and millennials (77%) believe GenAI will impact the way they work within the next year.

GenAI users are making use of the technology's versatility to help them in the workplace. Gen Zs and millennials are using GenAI for data analysis, design and creative work, and content creation, such as writing articles, social media posts, or scripts for videos. To a slightly lesser extent, some are using GenAI for project management, creating strategies, business ideas, or risk assessments, and for creating training materials.

### Current use of GenAI tools at work

### Benefits and concerns

Among those who already use GenAI at work, Gen Zs and millennials are broadly optimistic about its impact. They believe it has improved the quality of their work (78% of Gen Zs and 82% of millennials), and that it has helped to free up their time and improved their work/life balance (77% of Gen Zs and 79% of millennials). When asked the top impacts of GenAI on their careers so far, roughly a quarter (28%) of both generations say that GenAI has simplified routine tasks and increased efficiency, improved overall productivity (25% of Gen Zs and 26% of millennials), and enhanced creativity and innovation (25% of Gen Zs and 24% of millennials). Twenty percent of Gen Zs and millennials say that GenAI has freed them up to focus on more strategic work.

But they do have some significant concerns. They worry GenAI will eliminate jobs (63% of Gen Zs and 65% of millennials) and make it harder for younger generations to enter the workforce as it automates tasks typically performed by entry-level workers (61% of Gen Zs and millennials). The prevalence of GenAI is also causing many (66% of Gen Zs and 68% of millennials) to say they will look for job opportunities that they perceive as being safe from GenAI-driven disruption, such as manual labor or skilled trades. This is up from last year, when less than six in 10 Gen Zs (59%) and just over half of millennials (52%) said the same.

### Training and skills development

As GenAI continues to transform organizations and the way people work, Gen Zs and millennials are focused on training. Almost one-fifth of Gen Zs (17%) and millennials (19%) say they have already completed some GenAI training while more than one-third of Gen Zs (36%) and millennials (37%) say they plan to engage in GenAI training within the next year. And companies are already seeing the benefits: According to the Deloitte US quarterly [State of GenAI in the Enterprise report](#), in the first quarter of 2024, 36% of global CxOs believed that a lack of technical talent and skills was a major barrier holding their organization back in developing and deploying GenAI tools. However, by the fourth quarter of the same year, that percentage decreased to 26%.

Although technical GenAI skills are important, Gen Zs and millennials believe developing soft skills, such as empathy and leadership, are most important to their career development. Six in 10 Gen Zs (59%) and millennials (62%) believe that GenAI skills are somewhat or highly required for their career advancement, while more than eight in 10 (86% of Gen Zs and 85% of millennials) believe soft skills are somewhat or highly required. Most Gen Zs (72%) and millennials (76%) believe that their employers place a balanced emphasis on these two skill sets, suggesting that soft skills will continue to be very important. The [Human Capital Trends](#) report reinforces this, suggesting that soft skills, including curiosity and emotional intelligence, are so important now because they are essential to adaptability, which is critical as people navigate rapidly evolving workplaces.

*"I have mixed feelings about GenAI. I am really not worried that it will replace my profession, certainly not within the next five years. I would say that in some ways, it makes our work a little bit easier."*

### Takeaways for business leaders

Gen Zs and millennials are generally positive about the impact GenAI has on their work, but they have big picture concerns about what it may mean for their careers. It is up to business leaders to illustrate the transformative impact GenAI can have on an organization. By clearly communicating AI's role in job transformation, career growth, and work/life balance, leaders can help create workforce trust. Their advocacy can help create enthusiasm and drive engagement [at all levels](#).

It will also be critical for business leaders to prioritize training and reskilling programs to prepare the workforce—this includes technical training and the development of soft skills such as emotional intelligence, strategic thinking, empathy, and leadership. In the near term, AI fluency and education will be especially important to fostering adoption and overcoming initial resistance to change. In the longer term, upskilling or reskilling and redesigning work processes and career paths will likely be essential for capturing GenAI's full value and positioning workers for future success. As GenAI makes it harder for some to gain entry level experience, organizations should rethink how they source and develop talent. This may mean shifting from rigid experience requirements to skills and potential-based hiring.

Career fluidity is a defining feature of the modern workforce. The factors that attract Gen Zs and millennials to an employer are not always the same things that make them stay. One-fifth of Gen Zs (21%) and more than a quarter (28%) of millennials are no longer working in the industry or career path they originally intended. Nearly one-third (31%) of Gen Zs plan to switch employers in the next two years. And while millennials may be more settled into their careers, still 17% say they plan to leave their employer within two years.

Their penchant for job hopping isn't driven by a lack of loyalty. Many Gen Zs and millennials see it as a strategy to seek stability, better work/life balance, a greater sense of purpose, and an opportunity to learn and acquire new skills. When asked about their career goals and the factors that cause them to change careers or employers, responses generally fell into three categories: money, meaning, and well-being.

### Top career goals

The intersection of Money, Meaning, and Well-being results in Happiness.

While money, meaning, and well-being can be seen as separate, and often competing, priorities, the survey data reinforces how tightly interconnected each of these areas are.

For example, without financial security, Gen Zs and millennials are less likely to have a positive sense of mental well-being, and less likely to feel their work is meaningful. And positive well-being supports a sense of purpose at work. The survey data below illustrates the tight interconnections between pay satisfaction, mental well-being, and meaningful contribution:

| Condition                      | Group       | Report Good Mental Well-being (%) | Believe Job Enables Meaningful Contribution (%) |
|--------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Satisfied with Pay/Benefits    | Gen Z       | 62                                |                                                 |

Balancing money, meaning, and well-being sets the foundation for overall happiness among Gen Zs and millennials. And for employers, it may hold a key to attracting talent, reducing turnover, and increasing engagement.

*"The trifecta is flexibility, pay, and interest in work. And it's very hard to get all three."*

*– Millennial, Female*

#### Happiness = **MONEY** + meaning + well-being

For Gen Zs and millennials, financial stability is vital to their happiness: The more financially secure they feel, the more likely they are to say they are happy. Six in 10 financially secure Gen Zs (60%) and seven in 10 financially secure millennials (68%) say they felt happy with their life over the past year. Among those who feel financially insecure, only 28% of Gen Zs and 31% of millennials say they are happy. And those who are concerned about the cost of living also report lower levels of happiness: Only 36% of Gen Zs and 39% of millennials with cost-of-living concerns say they felt happy over the past year.

Fears surrounding money also take a toll on overall mental health. More than eight in 10 respondents cited their long-term financial future and their day-to-day finances as factors contributing to their feelings of anxiety or stress.

#### Happiness = money + **MEANING** + well-being

Purpose influences motivation and engagement, and according to 89% of Gen Zs and 92% of millennials, it is important to job satisfaction and well-being. Many Gen Zs and millennials want to find meaning in their careers and often seek out work that allows them to derive a broader sense of purpose. When evaluating a potential employer, more than half of Gen Zs (54%) and millennials (53%) say meaningful work is very important.

And when they find meaningful work that aligns with their personal values, they are more likely to say they are happy. Among those who are satisfied that their organization's values are aligned with their own, 52% of Gen Zs and 59% of millennials say they are happy. When dissatisfied with how their organization's values align, that number drops to 31% of Gen Zs and 34% of millennials. Similarly, among those who agree that their job enables them to make a meaningful contribution to society, 54% of Gen Zs and 62% of millennials say they are happy, compared to 34% of Gen Zs and millennials who say they are happy but disagree.

{26}------------------------------------------------

#### Happiness = money + meaning + WELL-BEING

Gen Zs and millennials who say their leaders support their mental health, who have opportunities to grow within their organizations, and who are satisfied with their work/life balance are more likely to say they have positive well-being, and by extension are more likely to report higher levels of happiness at work.

Well-being is critical to Gen Z and millennial happiness both in and outside of the workplace. Among those who rate their mental well-being as good, 62% of Gen Zs and 67% of millennials report being happy, versus only 19% of Gen Zs and 20% of millennials with poor mental well-being who say the same.

A woman standing on a busy city street, looking stressed or overwhelmed, with her hand on her forehead.

For the fourth year in a row, cost of living tops the list of concerns for Gen Zs and millennials, rising from 29% in 2022 to 39% in 2025 for Gen Zs and 36% to 42% for millennials. The gap between this and their other concerns, such as the environment, mental health, and personal safety, reveals how heavily the cost of living is weighing on their minds.

### Top concerns

| 2024 millennials | 32% |

Q. Thinking about your finances, to what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? I feel financially secure

Fueling these concerns is a rising sense of financial insecurity. Nearly half of Gen Zs (48%) and millennials (46%) say they do not feel financially secure, compared to 30% of Gen Zs and 32% of millennials in 2024. More than half (52%) of both Gen Zs and millennials are living paycheck to paycheck and more than one-third struggle to pay their living expenses each month (37% of Gen Zs and 35% of millennials). These generations are also worried about their financial futures, with about 40% of Gen Zs and millennials indicating they are worried about their ability to retire comfortably.

### Side jobs

Financial concerns continue to drive many Gen Zs and millennials to take on side jobs. Around one-third of Gen Zs and millennials have a side job in addition to their primary job. While needing a secondary source of income is the primary reason Gen Zs (37%) and millennials (41%) cite for having a second job, many also say that it helps them develop important skills and relationships (30% of both generations), is a hobby of theirs (28% of Gen Zs and 30% of millennials), and that it allows them to make a positive impact in their community or society (25% of both generations).

### Phantom wealth

Amid this growing and persistent financial anxiety, there is speculation that the financial situation for these generations may be starting to shift. For example, according to [Federal Reserve data](#), millennials in the United States have quadrupled their wealth over the past five years, leaving them with more wealth compared to previous generations at the same age. And globally, some reports are projecting that Gen Zs will soon become the [wealthiest generation](#) in history.

Yet, most Gen Zs and millennials clearly do not feel rich. Even those who consider themselves to be financially secure are feeling uneasy: Nearly one-third of financially secure Gen Zs (30%) and millennials (31%) still say that the cost of living is a top concern. This suggests that the disparity between these projections and the deep financial concerns expressed in this survey are likely due to continued inflation and a [higher cost of living](#) than previous generations experienced. And, particularly among millennials, much of this wealth is “[phantom wealth](#)” meaning that a large share of their net worth is in the form of illiquid assets, such as appreciating homes and retirement accounts.

### Financial security and job satisfaction

Employers should stay focused on ensuring that their Gen Z and millennial employees feel financially secure as this has a direct impact, not only on an employee's happiness and well-being, but on their job satisfaction and the likelihood that they'd recommend their employer to a friend. For example, [employee promoters](#), those who are most likely to recommend their company as a place to work, exhibit higher levels of financial security compared to total respondents. Among Gen Zs, 49% feel financially secure, rising to 69% among Gen Z employee promoters. Similarly, 51% of millennials feel financially secure overall, compared to 73% of millennial employee promoters. Additionally, employee promoters are more likely to be confident in their ability to comfortably retire and to pay all of their expenses each month.

Financial security is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to a person's happiness and job satisfaction, but it is foundational. Without financial security, Gen Zs and millennials struggle to focus on other priorities within their lives and careers, such as meaningful work, flexibility, and work/life balance.

### Key Takeaways for business leaders

Amid rising financial insecurity, organizations have a responsibility to support the financial well-being of their employees. This starts with offering market-competitive salaries and benefits. Flexible benefits such as those relating to dependent care, health care, or commuting costs can also be a good option to help personalize benefits according to each person's needs. Organizations can also focus on mentorship, sponsorship, and learning and development opportunities to enable opportunities for career growth. And finally, providing financial education to ensure that Gen Zs and millennials understand how to best manage their finances and prepare for their futures is important.

*"The cost of living is linked to many factors that directly affect the daily needs and physical and mental health of citizens. Inflation and rising prices place a burden on households, especially those on lower incomes, and as a result they lack basic necessities. Also, the rising cost of living is taking a toll on mental health as people worry about their own survival and...their children's futures."*

## 6 | Prioritizing purpose: How these generations are seeking meaning at work

{33}------------------------------------------------

For many Gen Zs and millennials, their work is core to who they are and how they see themselves. More than four in 10 Gen Zs (41%) and millennials (46%) say their primary job is central to their identity, second only to their friends and family. Cultural activities (such as reading, playing or listening to music, seeing performances, etc.) and other hobbies are also important to them.

Perhaps it is because work is such a significant component of their personal identities that so many want their work to be purpose-driven. A majority of Gen Zs (89%) and millennials (92%) consider a sense of purpose to be very or somewhat important for their job satisfaction and well-being, up from 86% of Gen Zs and 89% of millennials in 2024.

### Most important factors to their sense of identity

### How Gen Zs and millennials define purpose-driven work

Purpose is highly subjective. When asked to define “purpose at work”, Gen Zs and millennials gave a variety of responses, from earning money (“To be comfortable and have the salary that I need”), learning new skills (“A job that allows you to develop your skills and gain a sense of accomplishment”), fulfillment (“if I enjoy my work and if I love to go to work”), moral alignment (“It means liking what I do, especially knowing that my work can help people and that it is governed by indispensable values”), and having an impact on society (“Purpose at work means the awareness that what I do has some broader meaning, whether it’s for the team, the organization, or society as a whole”).

“Purpose in the workplace means having a clear vision and goals. This not only makes us value our day-to-day work, but also helps us connect our work to important things in life, such as personal growth, creating a positive impact, or participating in solving social problems. Having a definite purpose allows us to work not just for money or recognition, but for self-development and ultimately for the good of the collective.”

### The impact of not having purpose-driven work

Though what it means to have purpose-driven work can vary from more personal objectives to a desire to drive broader societal change, going to work and feeling that it matters is important. In fact, when Gen Zs and millennials don't find their work meaningful, it can impact their mental health—four in 10 say that not getting a sense of meaning or purpose from work contributes to their feelings of anxiety and stress.

Without a sense of purpose at work, some members of these cohorts are willing to look elsewhere. Forty-four percent of Gen Zs and 45% of millennials have left a role they felt lacked purpose and around 40% of both groups have rejected an assignment or project or even a potential employer based on their personal ethics or beliefs.

### Purpose-driven work versus work as a means to an end

While purpose-driven work is important for many, and is strongly correlated to happiness at work, not everyone feels they can have it. Roughly a quarter (25% of Gen Zs and 22% of millennials) say their current job does not align with their values and beliefs.

In qualitative interviews this year, Gen Zs and millennials indicated that while making a meaningful contribution to society is important to them, it doesn't always need to be achieved at work. If they can't have it all, they sometimes prioritize work/life balance and a higher salary, which gives them the time and resources they need to affect the change they want to see in the world outside of working hours.

*"It'd be great to work for a company where you completely believe in what they're doing. But it really depends. I think that's a luxury to be able to work for a company that you truly love, and who does something that contributes to the world in the way that you want to contribute to the world...I try to find companies that do things that I believe in, but it's not a top priority for me... I care about maximizing and creating purpose in my life and contributing to the world outside my job. The job is merely a means to give me the resources to affect those changes that I want to see."*

### Takeaways for business leaders

To inspire employees and attract and retain top talent, organizations should clearly define and communicate their purpose. This will not only attract talent who feel aligned to that purpose, but also help employees find meaning in their work and stay connected to how their work supports the organization's broader purpose.

Understanding the broad range of factors that motivate Gen Zs and millennials and gives them purpose opens an opportunity for business leaders to respond to what workers need at an individual level. This can help improve performance, work quality, and business growth. Tapping into motivation as a means of influencing worker behavior requires two broad steps: [Understanding worker motivations](#) and using hyper-personalization approaches to create value for workers and the organization.

*"I do a lot of volunteering work, which I find to be more directly aligned with my values. It allows me to support causes I care about by contributing my time and money voluntarily. Ideally, I would work for a company that contributes to what I believe is good in the world."*

## 7 | Enhancing mental well-being by confronting workplace stress

{39}------------------------------------------------

Fewer than six in 10 Gen Zs (52%) and millennials (58%) rate their mental well-being as good/very good in this year's survey. And mental health, a critical component of well-being, has become one of their most pressing societal concerns. This year, Gen Zs ranked the mental health of their generation among their top societal concerns, second only to the cost of living, and above matters such as protecting the environment, unemployment, and political instability.

Concerns about mental health are prevalent for millennials as well, although it falls slightly further down their list of societal concerns. It ranked fourth for them this year, behind the cost of living, crime, and protecting the environment, and on par with their concerns about disease prevention, political instability, and unemployment.

### Factors driving high levels of stress and anxiety

The survey tracks stress and anxiety levels as a key indicator of mental health and finds that Gen Zs and millennials continue to report high stress levels. Four in 10 Gen Zs (40%) and 34% of millennials say they feel stressed or anxious all or most of the time, roughly consistent with last year. Finances are a top stress driver along with concerns about the health and welfare of their families. More than 30% of respondents (35% of Gen Zs and 33% of millennials) say their job contributes significantly to their stress levels.

### The relationship between work and mental well-being

Well-being in the modern work environment is strongly influenced by **several key factors**: leadership behaviors (do leaders recognize their people and foster an environment of psychological safety?), how the organization and jobs are designed (are workloads manageable and are there opportunities for growth and learning?), and ways of working across levels (do people have the power and flexibility to make decisions about when, where, and how they work?).

These factors also surface in the survey data. For example, Gen Zs and millennials who feel valued at work are more likely to report good mental well-being. Six in 10 Gen Zs (61%) and seven in ten millennials (68%) who feel satisfied with the recognition they receive for their work report good mental well-being, compared to 41% of Gen Zs and 45% of millennials who have positive mental well-being but are dissatisfied. And six in 10 Gen Zs (61%) and seven in ten millennials (69%) who are satisfied with their career growth opportunities report good mental well-being, compared to 41% of Gen Zs and 42% of millennials who are dissatisfied with this aspect of their current job.

These themes also emerge when looking at the reasons Gen Zs and millennials say they feel stressed at work. Among those who say their job causes stress, the top reasons they cite are long working hours and a lack of recognition. Nearly half of these groups (48% of Gen Zs and 47% of millennials) say both contribute “a lot” to their feelings of anxiety or stress at work. Toxic workplace cultures (for 44% of Gen Zs and 45% of millennials), unfair decision-making practices (for 44% of both Gen Zs and millennials), and not feeling included by their colleagues (for 36% of Gen Zs and 33% of millennials) are also leading to stress and anxiety in the workplace.

### How managers can help address the root causes of stress

Many workplace stress drivers align to areas which Gen Zs and millennials say they'd like to see their managers doing more to support, underscoring the important role managers play in addressing the root causes of workplace stress. For example, as long working hours contribute to stress, Gen Zs and millennials believe managers should be doing more to set boundaries and support work/life balance. When asked specifically how they'd like their organization to foster better work/life balance, allowing flexible working hours came out on top for Gen Zs and millennials, followed by fostering supportive leaders through mental-health related trainings.

With concerns about toxic workplace cultures, lack of recognition, and unfair decision-making practices, more than four in 10 Gen Zs and millennials also believe managers have a responsibility to foster a positive and inclusive work culture (42% of Gen Zs and 41% of millennials), but only 22% of Gen Zs and 21% of millennials believe that is happening.

*"I feel like the managers leading the team are very important to mental health because they help control your workload. If they're giving you very tight deadlines, not being realistic, or not willing to work with you, that does impact mental health. You are more anxious about getting your stuff done on time so that the team doesn't fall down because you're late on your work."*

#### Discomfort speaking about mental health at work highlights persistent stigma

When it comes to comfort speaking with managers about mental health, the results are mixed. Around two-thirds of Gen Zs (62%) and millennials (64%) say they feel comfortable speaking openly with their direct manager about their mental health, although slightly fewer believe that their manager would know how to support if these concerns were raised (58% of Gen Zs and 59% of millennials). And about a quarter of respondents worry that their manager would discriminate against them if they raised mental health concerns (26% of both Gen Zs and millennials), which underscores persistent stigma related to mental health at work.

To further explore stigma around mental health, the survey tracks the extent to which stress and anxiety results in people needing to take time off from work, and their comfort disclosing workplace stress and anxiety as a cause. Three-quarters of Gen Zs (74%) and more than two-thirds of millennials (68%) say they have needed to take time off due to stress. Yet less than half (43% of Gen Zs and 37% of millennials) actually took time off, and among them, 22% of Gen Zs and 19% of millennials gave their employer a different reason for their absence.

### Employer progress on mental health

There are some positive signs that employers are taking steps to address mental health. Sixty-two percent of Gen Zs and millennials agree that their employer takes the mental health of employees seriously, up roughly 8% from last year. And more than half (58% of both groups) also say their employer has policies and assistance to help in relation to mental health.

It's important that this progress continues given the significant concerns about mental health that these generations express. Employers, senior leaders, and managers have an important role to play in not only addressing mental health concerns at work but helping to prevent them in the first place by addressing the root causes of stress, anxiety, and poor mental health.

### Takeaways for business leaders

With a prevention over cure mindset, employers can consider alternative ways to organize work to reduce key stressors and protect mental health and well-being. Managers have a key role to play here. They should be attuned to the stress drivers of their teams and empowered to mitigate concerns. This may include restructuring work, setting boundaries to support work/life balance, focusing on worker recognition, and providing opportunities for growth and learning. They should also be equipped to have open conversations about mental health and know how to point people to the right resources for help if they need it. Businesses that demonstrate a commitment to mental health and well-being, and which empower managers to foster positive work environments, will likely see organizational benefits and a happier, more engaged workforce.

*"If I'm working to a point where it is impacting my mental health, and I don't have some kind of identity outside of work, I think that's kind of the boundary. It's a point you reach where you're like, this is not okay anymore. I'm not mentally okay."*

## 8 | Anxiety and action: How environmental concerns shape Gen Z and millennial behavior

{45}------------------------------------------------

The environment is a major source of anxiety for these generations, with two-thirds (65% of Gen Zs and 63% of millennials) saying they have felt worried or anxious about the environment in the past month. Only 24% of Gen Zs and 29% of millennials indicate they have NOT experienced any extreme weather-related events in the past year, suggesting that an overwhelming majority have lived through one or more of these events, such as extreme heat, fire, or water shortages.

### Consumer action

Their environmental concerns influence their consumer behavior. Nearly two-thirds of Gen Zs (65%) and millennials (63%) say they are willing to pay more for environmentally sustainable products or services. Nearly one-fifth of Gen Zs (17%) and millennials (19%) have purchased an electric or hybrid vehicle and nearly half (45% of Gen Zs and 44% of millennials) plan to purchase one in the future. More than a quarter (26% of Gen Zs and 27% of millennials) have upgraded their homes with more sustainable features, such as solar panels or geothermal heating and cooling systems, while 45% of Gen Zs and 44% of millennials plan to in the future. Additionally, some are taking more affordable every-day actions to reduce their environmental impact: 43% of Gen Zs and 47% of millennials have taken steps to conserve water, such as taking shorter showers or collecting rainwater, and 36% of Gen Zs and 37% of millennials have started to take more energy efficient transportation instead of driving a car. Gen Zs and millennials are also discerning when it comes to the businesses they support—one quarter of Gen Zs (26%) and millennials (25%) have conducted research on a company's environmental impact or policies before buying a product or service from them.

### Employee advocacy

Worries about their environmental impact not only affect their spending habits, but also how they evaluate the companies they decide to work for. Two out of 10 Gen Zs (23%) and millennials (22%) say they have researched a company's environmental impact or policies before accepting a job from them. More than one out of 10 (15% Gen Zs and 13% millennials) have changed jobs due to concerns about its environmental impact. Seven out of 10 Gen Zs and millennials (70%) consider a company's environmental credentials or policies to be very/somewhat important when evaluating a potential employer. And 48% of Gen Zs and 47% of millennials say that they and their colleagues have put pressure on their employers to take action on protecting the environment.

#### Corporate confidence versus youth skepticism

There seems to be a disconnect between Gen Zs and millennials and the executives they work for when it comes to their environmental outlook. [According to the Deloitte Global CxO Sustainability report](#), 92% of global CxOs are somewhat or extremely optimistic the world will take sufficient steps to protect the environment while nearly half of Gen Zs (50%) and millennials (47%) are somewhat or extremely pessimistic this will happen. Gen Zs and millennials want businesses to do more: Only slightly more than half believe large companies are taking enough steps to protect the environment, with 80% saying they believe businesses could, and should, do more to be sustainable.

### Takeaways for business leaders

Gen Zs and millennials continue to be concerned about the environment, and these concerns influence their decisions about a wide range of factors, from where they shop to where they work. To attract Gen Zs and millennials as consumers, there is a large opportunity for businesses who can meet the growing demand for more affordable sustainable products and services. To attract and retain these generations as employees, organizations should consider the role their environmental policies play and ensure that they are communicating clearly and transparently about their sustainability commitments.

*"There's some room for individual personal impact, even though it's ultimately a small piece of the puzzle. Everyone should do common sense things like recycling, even if not all of it ends up where it should, taking the train instead of flying if possible, and generally trying to eat less meat. Being an early adopter of plant-based products can also help. I think there's some advancement that I can be on the forefront of."*

### What factors make an employee most likely to recommend their workplaces to friends and family?

This year's survey once again evaluated how likely respondents were to recommend their company as a place to work to their friends and family, using a scale from 0 to 10. Notably, more than a quarter of Gen Zs (28%) and one-third of millennials (34%) gave the highest ratings, a 9 or a 10. These respondents, referred to as employee promoters, represent the most satisfied and enthusiastic advocates for their companies, enhancing the organization's image and contributing positively to its growth by recommending it to others.

When examining satisfaction levels across various workplace experiences between employee promoters and the overall respondent pool, several key aspects stand out. Employee promoters, in comparison to the total respondent base, are much more likely to feel satisfied with both their opportunities to progress and grow in their careers and their pay and workplace benefits. They are also more likely to feel that they have a positive work/life balance, meaningful work, the power to drive change within their organizations, that their personal values are aligned with their employer, that their employer takes the mental health of its employees seriously, and to rate their overall well-being as good or extremely good.

These insights underscore the importance of addressing workplace priorities that resonate with Gen Zs and millennials. By effectively supporting these priorities, organizations might achieve higher engagement levels and cultivate loyal brand ambassadors who actively contribute to the organization's success and positive public image.

## Research methodology

Deloitte Global's 2025 Gen Z and Millennial Survey reflects the responses of 14,751 Gen Zs and 8,731 millennials (23,482 respondents in total), from 44 countries across North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. The survey was conducted using an online, self-complete-style interview. Fieldwork was completed between 25 October and 24 December 2024.

The report includes quotes from survey respondents who answered open-ended questions, as well as from participants in one-on-one, ethnography style qualitative interviews conducted separately from the online survey. The qualitative interviews were conducted between 19 December 2024 and 10 January 2025. All quotes are attributed to respondents by generation and gender.

The report represents a broad range of respondents, from those with executive positions in large organizations to others who are participating in the gig economy, doing unpaid work or are unemployed. Additionally, respondents include students who have completed or are pursuing degrees, those who have completed or plan to complete vocational studies, and others who are in secondary school and may or may not pursue higher education.

As defined in the study, Gen Z respondents were born between January 1995 and December 2006\*, and millennial respondents were born between January 1983 and December 1994.

\*Gen Zs are typically defined as being born between January 1995 and December 2010, but this study does not include respondents younger than 18, so each year the definition of Gen Zs in this survey shifts a year to include all adult Gen Zs.
