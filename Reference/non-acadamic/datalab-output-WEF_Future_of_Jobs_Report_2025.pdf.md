Over the past decade, the World Economic Forum's bi-annual *Future of Jobs Report* has followed evolving technological, societal and economic trends to understand occupational disruption and identify opportunities for workers to transition to the jobs of the future.

As we enter 2025, the landscape of work continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Transformational breakthroughs, particularly in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), are reshaping industries and tasks across all sectors. These technological advances, however, are converging with a broader array of challenges, including economic volatility, geoeconomic realignments, environmental challenges and evolving societal expectations. In response, this fifth edition of the *Future of Jobs Report* expands its focus, offering a comprehensive analysis of the interconnected trends shaping the global labour market.

Central to the report is a unique dataset derived from an extensive survey of global employers. This year's edition captures the perspectives of over 1,000 employers – representing more than 14 million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55 economies – providing unparalleled insights into

the emerging jobs landscape for the 2025-2030 period. This report would not be possible without their openness to contributing their views and insights, and we sincerely thank them all. We greatly appreciate, too, the support of our survey partners, which have enhanced the report's geographical coverage.

These perspectives are further enriched by research collaborations and data partnerships with ADP, Coursera, Indeed and LinkedIn, whose innovative data and analysis complement the survey findings.

This publication has been made possible by the dedication and expertise of its project team: Till Leopold, Attilio Di Battista, Ximena Játiva, Shuvashish Sharma, Ricky Li and Sam Grayling, alongside the wider team at the Centre for the New Economy and Society.

The disruptions of recent years have underscored the importance of foresight and collective action. We hope this report will inspire an ambitious, multistakeholder agenda – one that equips workers, businesses, governments, educators and civil society to navigate the complex transitions ahead.

# Key findings

Technological change, geoeconomic fragmentation, economic uncertainty, demographic shifts and the green transition – individually and in combination – are among the major drivers expected to shape and transform the global labour market by 2030. *The Future of Jobs Report 2025* brings together the perspective of over 1,000 leading global employers – collectively representing more than 14 million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55 economies from around the world – to examine how these macrotrends impact jobs and skills, and the workforce transformation strategies employers plan to embark on in response, across the 2025 to 2030 timeframe.

- Broadening digital access is expected to be the most transformative trend – both across technology-related trends and overall – with 60% of employers expecting it to transform their business by 2030. Advancements in technologies, particularly AI and information processing (86%); robotics and automation (58%); and energy generation, storage and distribution (41%), are also expected to be transformative. These trends are expected to have a divergent effect on jobs, driving both the fastest-growing and fastest-declining roles, and fueling demand for technology-related skills, including AI and big data, networks and cybersecurity and technological literacy, which are anticipated to be the top three fastest-growing skills.
- Increasing cost of living ranks as the second-most transformative trend overall – and the top trend related to economic conditions – with half of employers expecting it to transform their business by 2030, despite an anticipated reduction in global inflation. General economic slowdown, to a lesser extent, also remains top of mind and is expected to transform 42% of businesses. Inflation is predicted to have a mixed outlook for net job creation to 2030, while slower growth is expected to displace 1.6 million jobs globally. These two impacts on job creation are expected to increase the demand for creative thinking and resilience, flexibility, and agility skills.
- Climate-change mitigation is the third-most transformative trend overall – and the top trend related to the green transition – while climate-change adaptation ranks sixth with 47% and 41% of employers, respectively, expecting these trends to transform their business in the next five years. This is driving demand for roles such as renewable energy engineers, environmental engineers and electric and autonomous vehicle specialists, all among the 15 fastest-growing jobs. Climate trends are also expected to drive an increased focus on environmental stewardship, which has entered the *Future of Jobs Report*'s list of top 10 fastest growing skills for the first time.
- Two demographic shifts are increasingly seen to be transforming global economies and labour markets: aging and declining working age populations, predominantly in higher-income economies, and expanding working age populations, predominantly in lower-income economies. These trends drive an increase in demand for skills in talent management, teaching and mentoring, and motivation and self-awareness. Aging populations drive growth in healthcare jobs such as nursing professionals, while growing working-age populations fuel growth in education-related professions, such as higher education teachers.
- Geoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical tensions are expected to drive business model transformation in one-third (34%) of surveyed organizations in the next five years. Over one-fifth (23%) of global employers identify increased restrictions on trade and investment, as well as subsidies and industrial policies (21%), as factors shaping their operations. Almost all economies for which respondents expect these trends to be most transformative have significant trade with the United States and/or China. Employers who expect geoeconomic trends to transform their business are also more likely to offshore – and even more likely to re-shore – operations. These trends are driving demand for security related job roles and increasing demand for network and cybersecurity skills. They are also increasing demand for other human-centred skills such as resilience, flexibility and agility skills, and leadership and social influence.

Extrapolating from the predictions shared by Future of Jobs Survey respondents, on current trends over the 2025 to 2030 period job creation and destruction due to structural labour-market transformation will amount to 22% of today's total jobs. This is expected to entail the creation of new jobs equivalent to 14% of today's total employment, amounting to 170 million jobs. However, this growth is expected to be offset by the displacement of the equivalent of 8% (or 92 million) of current jobs, resulting in net growth of 7% of total employment, or 78 million jobs.

{5}------------------------------------------------

- Frontline job roles are predicted to see the largest growth in absolute terms of volume and include Farmworkers, Delivery Drivers, Construction Workers, Salespersons, and Food Processing Workers. Care economy jobs, such as Nursing Professionals, Social Work and Counselling Professionals and Personal Care Aides are also expected to grow significantly over the next five years, alongside Education roles such as Tertiary and Secondary Education Teachers.
- Technology-related roles are the fastest-growing jobs in percentage terms, including Big Data Specialists, Fintech Engineers, AI and Machine Learning Specialists and Software and Application Developers. Green and energy transition roles, including Autonomous and Electric Vehicle Specialists, Environmental Engineers, and Renewable Energy Engineers, also feature within the top fastest-growing roles.
- Clerical and Secretarial Workers – including Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, and Administrative Assistants and Executive Secretaries – are expected to see the largest decline in absolute numbers. Similarly, businesses expect the fastest-declining roles to include Postal Service Clerks, Bank Tellers and Data Entry Clerks.

On average, workers can expect that two-fifths (39%) of their existing skill sets will be transformed or become outdated over the 2025-2030 period. However, this measure of “skill instability” has slowed compared to previous editions of the report, from 44% in 2023 and a high point of 57% in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic. This finding could potentially be due to an increasing share of workers (50%) having completed training, reskilling or upskilling measures, compared to 41% in the report’s 2023 edition.

- Analytical thinking remains the most sought-after core skill among employers, with seven out of 10 companies considering it as essential in 2025. This is followed by resilience, flexibility and agility, along with leadership and social influence.
- AI and big data top the list of fastest-growing skills, followed closely by networks and cybersecurity as well as technology literacy. Complementing these technology-related skills, creative thinking, resilience, flexibility and agility, along with curiosity and lifelong learning, are also expected to continue to rise in importance over the 2025-2030 period. Conversely, manual dexterity, endurance and precision stand out with notable net declines in skills demand, with 24% of respondents foreseeing a decrease in their importance.

While global job numbers are projected to grow by 2030, existing and emerging skills differences between growing and declining roles could exacerbate existing skills gaps. The

most prominent skills differentiating growing from declining jobs are anticipated to comprise resilience, flexibility and agility; resource management and operations; quality control; programming and technological literacy.

Given these evolving skill demands, the scale of workforce upskilling and reskilling expected to be needed remains significant: if the world’s workforce was made up of 100 people, 59 would need training by 2030. Of these, employers foresee that 29 could be upskilled in their current roles and 19 could be upskilled and redeployed elsewhere within their organization. However, 11 would be unlikely to receive the reskilling or upskilling needed, leaving their employment prospects increasingly at risk.

Skill gaps are categorically considered the biggest barrier to business transformation by Future of Jobs Survey respondents, with 63% of employers identifying them as a major barrier over the 2025-2030 period. Accordingly, 85% of employers surveyed plan to prioritize upskilling their workforce, with 70% of employers expecting to hire staff with new skills, 40% planning to reduce staff as their skills become less relevant, and 50% planning to transition staff from declining to growing roles.

Supporting employee health and well-being is expected to be a top focus for talent attraction, with 64% of employers surveyed identifying it as a key strategy to increase talent availability. Effective reskilling and upskilling initiatives, along with improving talent progression and promotion, are also seen as holding high potential for talent attraction. Funding for - and provision of - reskilling and upskilling are seen as the two most welcomed public policies to boost talent availability.

The Future of Jobs Survey also finds that adoption of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives remains on the rise. The potential for expanding talent availability by tapping into diverse talent pools is highlighted by four times more employers (47%) than two years ago (10%). Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have become more prevalent, with 83% of employers reporting such an initiative in place, compared to 67% in 2023. Such initiatives are particularly popular for companies headquartered in North America, with a 96% uptake rate, and for employers with over 50,000 employees (95%).

By 2030, just over half of employers (52%) anticipate allocating a greater share of their revenue to wages, with only 8% expecting this share to decline. Wage strategies are driven primarily by goals of aligning wages with workers’ productivity and performance and competing for retaining talent and skills. Finally, half of employers plan to re-orient their business in response to AI, two-thirds plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks.

# Introduction: The global labour market landscape in 2025

The year 2025 unfolds amid ongoing transformations in global labour markets. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, rising cost of living, geopolitical conflicts, the climate emergency and economic downturns have added further turbulence to technology-driven global employment changes. While the global economic outlook appears to be stabilizing, it does so amid weaker global growth projections of 3.2% for 2025.<sup>1</sup> Global inflation appears to have eased and is now projected to reach 3.5% by the end of 2025 – below the average global rate of the first two decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. However, living costs remain elevated around the world.

Aided by a stabilizing economic outlook and easing inflation, the global unemployment rate, at 4.9%,<sup>2</sup> stands at the lowest level since 1991. However, this headline figure hides a range of disparities. While middle-income countries are experiencing reductions in unemployment, low-income countries have seen an increase, from 5.1% in 2022 to 5.3% by 2024.

Reductions in unemployment have also lagged for women. Since 2020, when the global unemployment rate peaked for both sexes at 6.6%, the rate for men has declined to 4.8%, while the rate for women remains elevated at 5.2%. This trend is driven mainly by lower-middle income countries, where the female unemployment rate (of 5.5%) is 1.1% higher than the male equivalent. High-income countries have an unemployment rate gender disparity of 0.4%; however, this disparity has existed for over a decade – rather than opening up during the post-COVID recovery. For low-income and upper-middle income countries, male and female unemployment rates remain even.

Youth unemployment rates tell another story of labour-market health. While the global youth unemployment rate has tracked the total global unemployment rate, it remains elevated at 13%. Assessing rates of youth not in employment education or training (NEETs) highlights disparities between economies at different national income levels. While the global NEET rate remains flat at

21.7%, it stands at just 10.1% for high-income economies, rising to 17.3% for upper-middle income ones. The rate then jumps to 25.9% for lower-middle income economies and 27.6% for low-income ones.

The jobs gap – a measure by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to incorporate a broader understanding of unemployment and underemployment – adds additional nuance to our understanding of the labour-market situation. Similarly to global headline unemployment, the jobs gap has been decreasing and stood at a need for 402 million additional jobs in 2024. While most of the world has experienced this downward trend, low-income economies saw their jobs gap increase by 0.4 percentage points compared to pre-pandemic levels. Lower-middle income economies saw the largest reduction in the jobs gap (by 2 percentage points compared to 2019 levels). Across all country income groups, the jobs gap for women is higher than that for men, but gender differences are most pronounced in low-income and especially lower-income economies, where the jobs gap for women surpasses that of men by 7.5 percentage points.

The global labour-force participation rate has rebounded after a drop during the pandemic and now stands at similar levels to 2019 for all income groups except lower-middle income economies. In lower-income economies the labour-force participation rate has spiked beyond the levels seen in 2019. This is noteworthy considering lower-middle income economies – who make up around 40% of the global population – will drive the bulk of working-age population growth in the coming years and decades. The combination of growing working-age populations and labour-force participation rates emphasizes the importance of job creation in these economies.

Against the backdrop of this current labour-market landscape, the *Future of Jobs Report 2025* analyses how organizations expect the labour market to evolve over the next five years until 2030. Like previous editions of the report, this analysis is

{8}------------------------------------------------

based on the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Survey, conducted in late 2024, which brings together the perspectives of more than 1,000 global employers, collectively employing more than 14.1 million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55 economies. The survey highlights how macrotrends and technology will influence industry transformation and employment, the jobs and skills outlook over the next five years and the corresponding workforce transformation strategies companies plan to use to address these issues.

The report begins by outlining five macrotrends impacting the labour market – technological change, the green transition, geoeconomic fragmentation, economic uncertainty and demographic shifts. In Chapter 2, the report discusses how organizations expect jobs to evolve, including which jobs are predicted to grow

and decline fastest, and the trends driving these changes. Chapter 3 looks at projected changes to the skills needed in the labour market, before Chapter 4 analyses the workforce practices that employers plan to adopt in their organizations. Finally, Chapter 5 provides insights for the nine regions, 55 economies, and 22 industry clusters that meet the report's statistical thresholds for standalone analysis. The appendix provides a detailed overview of the report's survey and analysis methodology.

In addition, the *Future of Jobs Report 2025* features a comprehensive set of Region, Economy and Industry Profiles. User guides are provided for each of these profiles to support their use as practical, standalone tools.

# Drivers of labour-market transformation

Technological developments, the green transition, macroeconomic and geoeconomic shifts, and demographic changes are driving transformation in the global labour market, reshaping both jobs and

required skills. This chapter provides a picture of how companies expect these macrotrends to drive industry transformation by 2030.

### Technological change

More employers – 60% – expect broadening digital access to transform their business than any other trend, with similar proportions of employers across

all regions selecting this trend. This growing digital access is a critical enabler for new technologies to transform labour markets (Figure 1.1).

The Future of Jobs Survey asked employers how advances in nine key technologies are transforming

{10}------------------------------------------------

their business. Of the nine technologies, three stand out as being expected to have the greatest impact. Robots and autonomous systems are expected to transform 58% of employers' businesses, while energy generation and storage technologies are expected to transform 41%. But it is artificial

intelligence (AI) and information processing technologies that are expected to have the biggest impact – with 86% of respondents expecting these technologies to transform their business by 2030 (Figure 1.2).

Generative AI (GenAI), in particular, has witnessed a rapid surge in both investment and adoption across various sectors. Since the release of Chat GPT in November 2022, investment flows into AI have increased nearly eightfold.<sup>9</sup> This influx of capital has been accompanied by investment in the physical infrastructure needed to support these emerging technologies, including servers and energy generation plants. By leveraging natural language processing technology, GenAI enables users to interact with it as though they were conversing with a human, considerably reducing barriers to usage and the need for specialized technical knowledge.<sup>4</sup> Accordingly, the demand for GenAI skills by both businesses and individuals has also grown significantly (Box B1.1).

Although more generalized adoption of AI applications remains comparatively low, with only a small fraction of firms using it in 2023, adoption is growing rapidly, albeit unevenly across sectors. The information technology sector is leading the way in AI adoption, while industries such as construction are lagging behind.<sup>5</sup> This disparity mirrors broader trends, with advanced and middle-income economies experiencing unprecedented diffusion of generative AI technologies among individual users, while low-income economies remain largely on the margins, with currently minimal use of this technology.<sup>6</sup>

While the full extent of long-term productivity gains from the technology remains uncertain,

workplace studies have identified various initial ways for generative AI to enhance human skills and performance. Some of these studies have highlighted ways for generative AI to enhance human core skills, or to substitute for tacit knowledge among newer or average performing workers.<sup>7,8</sup> Other studies have shown generative AI can enhance knowledge work if applied appropriately within its capability, but risks producing adverse outcomes where users unknowingly stretch it beyond its capability.<sup>9</sup>

Looking further ahead, some observers argue generative AI could empower less specialized employees to perform a greater range of “expert” tasks – expanding the possible functions of roles such as Accounting Clerks, Nurses, and Teaching Assistants.<sup>10</sup> Similarly, the technology could equip skilled professionals such as Electricians, Doctors or Engineers with the world’s forefront knowledge – enabling them to solve complex problems more efficiently.<sup>11</sup> Outcomes such as these – which create genuine shifts in the quantity or quality of output – are more likely to come about if technology development is focused on enhancing rather than substituting for human capabilities.<sup>12</sup> However, without appropriate decision-making frameworks, economic incentive structures and, possibly, government regulations, there remains a risk that technological development will be focused on replacing human work, which could increase inequality and unemployment.

{11}------------------------------------------------

While currently seen as less transformative than GenAI, robots and autonomous systems have seen steady growth of around 5-7% annually since 2020.<sup>13</sup> In 2023, global average robot density reached 162 units per 10,000 employees, double the number measured seven years ago.<sup>14</sup> Currently robot installations are heavily concentrated, with 80% of installations occurring in China, Japan, United States, the Republic of Korea, and

Germany.<sup>15</sup> This is partially reflected in Future of Jobs Survey data, which shows significant expectations for the transformative impact of these technologies in these five countries (more than 60% of respondents in each); but much lower expectations among employers headquartered in Sub-Saharan Africa (39%), Central Asia (45%) and the Middle East and North Africa (44%).

## BOX 1.1

### Demand for generative AI skills

In collaboration with Coursera

Coursera data generated for the *Future of Jobs Report 2025* reveals significant growth in demand for Generative AI training among both individual learners and enterprises (Figure B1.1). Demand for AI skills has accelerated globally, with India and the United States leading in enrolment numbers. However, the drivers of demand differ. In the United States demand is primarily driven by individual users, whereas in India, corporate sponsorship plays a significant role in boosting GenAI training uptake.

Globally, individual learners on Coursera have focused on foundational GenAI skills and

conceptual topics, such as prompt engineering, trustworthy AI practices, and strategic decision-making around AI. Institution-sponsored learners, on the other hand, emphasize practical applications within the workplace, including leveraging AI tools to enhance efficiency in Excel or leveraging the technology to develop applications. These trends reflect a tailored approach to GenAI learning, where individuals focus on foundational knowledge-building while organizations prioritize training that delivers immediate workplace productivity gains.

## Economic uncertainty

As of early 2025, the global economic outlook appears to be shaped by a combination of cautious optimism and persistent uncertainties. According to the World Economic Forum's September 2024 Chief Economists Outlook,<sup>16</sup> while there are signs of improving global conditions, vulnerabilities persist. Most surveyed chief economists (54%) expect economic conditions to hold steady in the short term. However, among those anticipating change, more expect conditions to worsen rather than strengthen.

The 2024 economic performance was marked by a global decrease in inflation and an unusually resilient economy throughout the disinflationary process. While easing inflation and looser monetary policy offer some optimism, slow growth and political volatility keep many countries at risk of economic shocks. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects growth to hold steady at 3.2 percent in 2025, despite sizable downward growth revisions in a few economies, particularly low-income developing ones.<sup>17</sup>

Despite this comparatively steady outlook, price pressures persist in many economies. Inflation remains particularly high in services – at almost twice pre-pandemic levels – and is especially persistent in low-income countries. Low-income countries are disproportionately affected by rising inflationary pressures because of elevated food prices due to supply disruptions influenced by climate shocks, regional conflicts and geopolitical tensions.<sup>18</sup>

Against this backdrop, companies expect economic pressures to be among the most transformative drivers. Figure 1.1 shows rising cost of living remains a top concern, with half of all surveyed employers expecting it to drive transformation, making it the second-most influential trend. Slower economic growth is also a major concern, with 42% of respondents expecting it to impact their operations.

Views on the impact of inflation and economic growth notably vary across regions. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, six in 10 respondents cite inflation as a key factor, whereas in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, slower economic growth is seen as the more important issue.

Finally, stricter anti-trust and competition regulations, though a lower priority overall, are expected to impact one in six employers globally

## Geoeconomic fragmentation

Intensifying geoeconomic tensions threaten trade and supply chains, with lower-income economies particularly vulnerable, given that essential goods like food and energy comprise a

larger share of household expenditures in these countries.<sup>19</sup> Globally, governments are responding to geoeconomic challenges by imposing trade and investment restrictions, increasing subsidies, and adjusting industrial policies. The World Trade Organization (WTO) reports that trade restrictions doubled between 2020 and 2024, with the value of import restrictions reaching nearly 10% of global imports in 2024.<sup>20</sup> These increasing protectionist measures may pose a medium-term risk to global economic growth, as they reduce opportunities for open innovation and technology transfer – factors that historically fuelled growth in emerging economies during periods of globalization.<sup>21</sup>

This shift toward geoeconomic fragmentation carries substantial macroeconomic implications, with the IMF estimating potential global output losses from trade fragmentation ranging from 0.2% to 7% of GDP, and losses deepening in scenarios of technological decoupling.<sup>22</sup> Emerging and developing economies are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa could see long-term welfare losses of approximately 4% of GDP due to declining global integration.<sup>23</sup>

The Future of Jobs Survey reveals that around one-third (34%) of surveyed employers see heightened geopolitical tensions and conflicts as a key driver of organizational transformation. Meanwhile just over one-fifth of surveyed organizations identify increased restrictions on trade and investment (23%), as well as subsidies and industrial policies (21%), as factors reshaping their operations.

Geoeconomic concerns vary by economy. Employers in Eastern Asia and Northern America identify rising geoeconomic fragmentation as a key driver shaping labour markets, with nearly half of surveyed employers in these regions citing this trend. These regions also show significant concern about restrictions on global trade and investment, though to a lesser extent than in the Middle East and North Africa. Economies with comparatively high trade volumes with the United States, China, or both – such as Singapore (64%) and the Republic of Korea (71%) – tend to expect greater transformation from each of these geoeconomic trends, as shown in Figure 1.3 below.

On an industry level, as shown in Figure 1.4, sectors with a high degree of dependence on global supply chains, such as Automotive and Aerospace (46%), and Mining and Metals (55%), expect industry transformation driven by trade restrictions. By contrast, industries with less exposure to global markets, such as Education, are less focused on this trend, with fewer than 14% of surveyed employers seeing trade restrictions as disruptive. Mining and Metals, Advanced Manufacturing, and Oil and Gas anticipate industry transformation stemming from increased government subsidies and industrial policies, with, respectively, 31%, 33%, and 40% of employers across these industries citing these factors; whereas more domestic-focused sectors such as Accommodation, Food, and Leisure expect minimal impact from such policies.

The broader implications of geoeconomic fragmentation extend beyond individual business strategies to long-term economic stability and growth, and limit multilateral cooperation on critical issues such as climate change and pandemic preparedness.<sup>24</sup>

## Green transition

Despite an increasingly complex outlook for global climate negotiations, the green transition remains a priority for many organizations globally. Nearly half of surveyed employers (47%) anticipate the ramping up of efforts and investments to reduce carbon emissions as a key driver for organizational transformation. Similarly, 41% expect that increased efforts and investments to adapt to climate change will drive significant organizational changes. These two trends rank 3rd and 6th, respectively, among the drivers of business transformation identified by the Future of Jobs Survey. These priorities have enabled green jobs to demonstrate resilience in recent years, with hiring rates in green sectors remaining relatively stable even throughout the pandemic-related disruptions of 2020.<sup>25</sup>

The Future of Jobs Survey finds that the industrial sector – encompassing industries such as Automotive and Aerospace, and Mining and Metals – anticipates significant organizational transformation as companies ramp up efforts to decarbonize: 71% of employers in the Automotive and Aerospace industry and 69% of those in the Mining and Metals industry expect carbon emissions reductions to transform their organizations. Given the carbon-intensive nature of these industries,<sup>26</sup> decarbonization will significantly transform these industries and their workforces, with workers requiring upskilling and reskilling to transition to alternative jobs.

A similar picture emerges across regions. For example, in South-Eastern Asia, 72% of employers expect climate mitigation efforts to transform their

{15}------------------------------------------------

organizations by 2030, while over half expect climate adaptation to do so. By contrast, in Central Asia, only 19% of respondents see climate trends as relevant to their business activities.

As countries seek to meet climate goals, questions arise regarding whether their workforces are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the demands of a net-zero future. The shift toward sustainable practices will require specialized expertise which will incur transition costs, particularly for those working in production occupations such as assemblers and fabricators.<sup>27</sup> Despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period. To fully capitalize on opportunities created by the green transition and harness them in a way that is fair and inclusive, prioritizing green skilling is essential.

## Demographic shifts

The world is currently experiencing two fundamental demographic shifts: an aging and declining working-age population predominantly in higher-income economies, due to declining birth rates and longer life expectancy, and a growing working-age population in many lower-income economies, where younger populations are progressively entering the labour market. In higher-income nations, aging populations are increasing dependency ratios, potentially putting greater pressure on a smaller pool of working-age individuals and raising concerns about long-term labour availability. In contrast, lower-income economies may benefit from a demographic dividend.

These demographic shifts have a direct impact on global labour supply: currently balanced between lower-income (49%) and higher-income (51%) working-age populations, this distribution is expected to shift by 2050, with lower-income countries projected to hold 59% of the global working-age population.<sup>29</sup> Geographies with a demographic dividend, such as India and Sub-Saharan African nations, will supply nearly two-thirds of new workforce entrants in the coming years.<sup>30</sup>

Findings from the Future of Jobs Survey indicate that for 40% of employers worldwide, aging and declining working-age populations are driving transformation, while 25% are being transformed by growing working-age populations. Many high-income economies experience the combined effects of both trends. Certain countries, including Australia, Germany and Japan, experience more significant effects from declining working-age populations. While few companies operating in Sub-Saharan African countries expect to see transformation due to aging and declining working age populations, their expectations regarding the impact of growing working-age populations are

also relatively tempered, illustrating relatively greater concern with other macro trends (Figure 1.5).

Compared to global averages, employers facing the effects of aging population are more pessimistic about talent availability and expect facing bigger challenges in attracting industry talent. More encouragingly, with a shrinking labour pool, many of these companies (60%) increasingly prioritize transitioning current employees into growing roles as a key workforce strategy. Some observers have also predicted that aging high-income economies with shrinking labour forces might increasingly look to deeper automation to counterbalance some of these demographic trends.<sup>31</sup> For example, the Future of Jobs Survey finds that employers expecting to be impacted by aging populations are more likely to accelerate process automation (79% versus 73% globally) and advance workforce augmentation (67% versus 63% globally) in the next five years.

Conversely, many economies' actual ability to leverage demographic dividends will depend on their accompanying success, or otherwise, in inclusive job creation. According to the World Bank, over the next 10 years, an unprecedented 1.2 billion young people in emerging economies will become working-age adults, while the job market in these economies is only expected to create 420 million additional jobs – risking leaving nearly 800 million young people in economic uncertainty.<sup>32</sup> Encouragingly, employers responding to the Future of Jobs Survey that identify growing working-age populations as a driver of transformation plan to prioritize reskilling and upskilling, with 92% indicating they will be focusing on these strategies by 2030.

# Jobs outlook

Technological change, the green transition, economic uncertainty, geoeconomic fragmentation and demographic shifts are reshaping the labour market. This chapter analyses how employers

expect various kinds of jobs to grow and decline in response to these macrotrends and assesses the role of each of these trends in contributing to labour-market transformation.

## 2.1 Total job growth and loss

By combining respondents' job growth and decline expectations with hard data on global employment collected by the ILO, the *Future of Jobs Report 2025* estimates that, by 2030, on current predictions, new job creation and job displacement due to macrotrends will represent a combined total of 22% of today's total (formal) jobs. Specifically, macrotrend-driven creation of new jobs is estimated to amount to 170 million jobs, equivalent to 14% of

today's total employment. This growth is expected to be offset by the displacement of 92 million current jobs, or 8% of total employment, resulting in a net growth of 78 million jobs (7% of today's total employment) by 2030, Figure 2.1 illustrates the total number of jobs expected to be created and displaced due to labour-market transformation relative to total employment today.

FIGURE 2.1 Global employment change by 2030

In the next five years, 170 million jobs are projected to be created and 92 million jobs to be displaced, constituting a structural labour market churn of 22% of the 1.2 billion formal jobs in the dataset being studied. This amounts to a net employment increase of 7%, or 78 million jobs.

## Growing and declining jobs

The Future of Jobs Survey gathered insights from employers on job roles expected to grow, decline or remain stable within their organizations over

the next five years. Respondents were then asked to identify the macrotrends and technological advancements driving job growth and decline in their organizations.

{18}------------------------------------------------

According to the surveyed executives, the fastest-growing job roles by 2030, in percentage terms, tend to be driven by technological developments, such as advancements in AI and robotics and increasing digital access (See section 2.2). Leading

the fastest growing jobs list are roles such as Big Data Specialist, FinTech Engineers, AI and Machine Learning Specialists and Software and Applications Developers (Figure 2.2).

While technology trends partly contribute to the growth of security-related roles such as Security Management Specialists, which ranks among the top five fastest-growing roles, increased geopolitical fragmentation contributes in large part to the growth of this role. Driven by the same combination of technology and geoeconomic trends, another security-related role, Information Security Analysts, also appears among the top 15.

Green and energy-transition roles, including Autonomous and Electric Vehicle Specialists, Environmental Engineers, and Renewable Energy Engineers, also feature within the top 15 fastest-growing roles. The growth of these roles is driven by increased efforts and investments to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change. The growing adoption of energy generation, storage and distribution technologies,

alongside other technology trends, are additional contributing factors.

By contrast, respondents expect the fastest-declining roles to include various clerical roles, such as Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, alongside Administrative Assistants and Executive Secretaries, Printing Workers, and Accountants and Auditors. Broadening digital access, AI and information processing technologies, and robots and autonomous systems are the primary drivers for this decline. Aging and declining working-age populations and slower economic growth also contribute to the decline in clerical roles.

Figure 2.3 provides the percentage growth and decline, alongside net growth outlook, for all roles featured in the Future of Jobs Survey that meet response thresholds.

A busy urban street scene with many pedestrians, cars, and a large clock in the foreground, symbolizing time and work.

To approximate the total impact of job growth and decline, this report combines the job outlook expectations of surveyed employers with estimates of the total number of workers in the corresponding roles, based on ILO employment data. However, the Future of Jobs data set only provides information on roles for which survey data availability meets a minimum coverage threshold, and corresponds to 1.18 billion workers in total, which is a subset of the ILO's total employment data. The conclusions derived for this subset should not be treated as comprehensive, but rather as providing insights on selected segments of the global workforce.

Figure 2.4 shows the 15 largest net growth and decline job roles in absolute numbers. The highest growth in absolute numbers of jobs is driven by roles that make up the core of many economies.

Farmworkers top the list of the largest growing job roles in the next five years and are expected to see 35 million more jobs by 2030. Green transition trends, including increased efforts and investments to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change, are the driving forces behind this job growth. Broadening digital access and rising cost of living also contribute to the growth of this job role, which currently employs more than 200 million workers worldwide.

Delivery Drivers, Building Construction Workers, Salespersons and Food Processing Workers are also among the largest-growing job types in the next five years. While technology is impacting growth in almost all occupations, demographic trends and economic trends also contribute to the projected net increase in these job roles.

Care jobs, including Nursing Professionals, Social Work and Counselling Professionals, and Personal

Care Aides are expected to see significant growth over the next five years, driven by demographic trends, especially aging populations. Increased focus on labour and social issues is also identified as a contributing factor.

Education-related roles such as University and Higher Education Teachers and Secondary Education Teachers are also predicted to be among the biggest job creators in absolute terms over the next five years globally. Broadening digital access and growing working-age populations are the top two contributing drivers of this job growth, while increased focus on labour and social issues is seen as an additional factor.

Additionally, Software and Applications Developers, General and Operations Managers, and Project Managers, are among the job categories driving the most net job growth.

Conversely, in parallel to the fastest-declining job roles, Clerical and Secretarial Workers are among the job categories predicted to see the largest net job decline in absolute terms (Figure 2.5).

Section 2.2 further analyses the impact of each of the five identified labour-market macrotrends on growing and declining jobs. However, there is also a group of large and growing jobs that are driven by many trends in combination. This includes Building Framers, Finishers, and Related Trades Workers; Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers; Car, Van and Motorcycle Drivers; General and Operations Managers; and Social Work and Counselling Professionals. For these jobs, it is the broad sweep of transformative forces, rather than one or two specific labour-market drivers, which is generating growth expectations.

## 2.2 Expected impact of macrotrends on employment

The remainder of this chapter discusses how Future of Jobs Survey respondents expect each of the five macrotrends driving labour market transformation – technological change, geoeconomic fragmentation,

green transition, demographic shifts and economic uncertainty – to influence job growth and decline by 2030 (see Figure 2.6).

FIGURE 2.6

### Expected impact of macrotrends and technology trends on jobs, 2025-2030

Projected job creation attributed to each trend (blue) and projected job displacement attributed to each trend (purple) between 2025 and 2030, based on the job growth and decline attribution expectations of surveyed employers and ILO employment figures by occupation. The projected net number of jobs created or destroyed attributed to each trend in the next five years (diamonds) is calculated by subtracting the total number of declining jobs from the total number of growing jobs. The Appendix provides additional details and the data behind this figure.

### Technological change

Technology is predicted to be the most divergent driver of labour-market change, with broadening digital access expected to both create and displace more jobs than any other macrotrend (19 million and 9 million, respectively). Meanwhile, trends in AI and information processing technology are expected to create 11 million jobs, while simultaneously displacing 9 million others, more

than any other technology trend. Robotics and autonomous systems are expected to be the largest net job displacer, with a net decline of 5 million jobs.

These three trends – broadening digital access, advancements in AI and information processing, and robotics and autonomous systems technologies – also feature prominently as drivers of the fastest growing and declining jobs. In fact,

{25}------------------------------------------------

they are among the top drivers of growth for the 10 fastest-growing jobs: AI and information processing technologies are among the top three drivers of growth for all 10 of these jobs; whereas broadening digital access is a top three driver for nine out of these 10 (all except Autonomous and Electric Vehicle Specialists); and robotics and autonomous systems technologies for seven out of these 10 (all except Security Management Specialists, UI and UX Designers, and Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers). In addition, of the 10 fastest- and 10 largest-declining roles, only two (Printing and Related Trades Workers, and Building Caretakers, Cleaners and Housekeepers) feature other trends among their top three drivers of job decline.

By contrast, the largest-growth jobs are influenced by a broader range of macrotrends. The three technology-based trends stand out as expected growth drivers only for light truck and delivery services drivers, software and applications developers, and nursing professionals. This projected growth in demand for nursing professionals is also driven by aging and declining working-age populations, further explored in the demographic shifts section of this chapter.

The presence of both Graphic Designers and Legal Secretaries just outside the top 10 fastest-declining

job roles, a first-time prediction not seen in previous editions of the *Future of Jobs Report*, may illustrate GenAI's increasing capacity to perform knowledge work. Job decline in both roles is seen as driven by both AI and information processing technologies as well as by broadening digital access. This is a major change from the report's 2023 edition, when Graphic Designers were considered a moderately growing job and Legal Secretaries did not feature in the expected job growth/decline list.

### The Shifting human-machine frontier: automation versus augmentation

The interplay between humans, machines and algorithms is redefining job roles across industries. Automation is expected to drive changes in people's ways of working, with the proportional share of tasks performed solely or predominantly by humans expected to decline as technology becomes more versatile. Future of Jobs Survey respondents estimate that, today, 47% of work tasks are performed mainly by humans alone, with 22% performed mainly by technology (machines and algorithms), and 30% completed by a combination of both. By 2030, employers expect these proportions to be nearly evenly split across these three categories/approaches (Figure 2.7).

Globally, the expected reduction in the proportion of work tasks performed by humans is driven primarily by increased automation. Of the nearly 15 percentage point reduction in the proportion of total work tasks delivered by humans in

2030 versus 2025, nearly 82% is attributable to advancing automation, while 19% is projected to derive from expanded human-machine collaboration (Figure 2.8).

Importantly, this analysis only compares the 2025 and 2030 proportions of total task delivery attributable to human employees, technology or collaboration between the two, respectively, and does not consider the potential change in the absolute amount of work tasks (output) getting done. In other words, both machines and humans might be significantly more productive in 2030 – performing more or higher value tasks in the same or less amount of time than it would have taken them to do so in 2025 – so any concern about humans “running out of things to do” due to automation would be misplaced.

However, a potentially more complex question raised by these projections concerns the on-going share of total economic value creation participated in by human workers: If an increasing amount of a firm's total output and income is derived from advanced machines and proprietary algorithms, to what extent will human workers be able to share in this prosperity?<sup>33</sup> It is in this context that the relevance of the third category/approach, human-machine collaboration (or “augmentation”) should be highlighted: technology could be designed and developed in a way that complements and enhances, rather than displaces, human work; and, as discussed further in the next chapter (Box 3.1), talent development, reskilling and upskilling strategies may be designed and delivered in a way to enable and optimize human-machine collaboration.<sup>34</sup> It is the investment decisions and policy choices made today that will shape these outcomes in the coming years.<sup>35</sup>

At an industry level, while all sectors are expected to see a reduction in the proportion of work tasks performed by humans alone by 2030, they differ in the share of this reduction that is projected to be attributable to automation versus augmentation and human-machine collaboration (Figure 2.9). Insurance and Pensions Management and Telecommunications are leading the automation trend – with more than 95% of human standalone task share reduction in both sectors expected to derive from deeper automation. By contrast, nearly half of the proportional reduction in work tasks done by humans alone in the Medical and Healthcare Services and Government and Public sectors are instead expected to be driven by increased augmentation and human-machine collaboration.

In four sectors – Oil and Gas, Chemicals and Advanced Materials, Financial Services and Capital Markets, and Electronics – automation is projected not only to reduce the proportion of total work tasks predominantly done today standalone by humans, but even to reduce the share of total work tasks currently delivered through human-machine collaboration (resulting in calculated “automation shares” of more than 100%, as depicted in Figure 2.9).

## Geoeconomic fragmentation

The Future of Jobs Survey asked employers about the impacts of three key geoeconomic trends: increased government subsidies and industrial policy; increased geopolitical division and conflicts; and increased restrictions to global trade and investment. On average, respondents expect these trends to be net job creators. Although projected to be three of the four lowest net job-creating macrotrends – above only slower economic growth – these estimates still equate to 5 million net additional jobs by 2030, most prominently in logistics, security and strategy roles.

Increased government subsidies and industrial policy are expected to drive increased demand for Business Intelligence Analysts and Business Development Professionals. Increased restrictions to global trade and investment are also predicted to drive growth in these roles, as well as in Strategic Advisors and Supply Chain and Logistics specialists. Increased geopolitical division and conflicts, meanwhile, are projected to drive growth in all of the aforementioned roles, in addition

to Information Security Analysts and Security Management Specialists.

The Future of Jobs Survey also asked respondents whether they expected to offshore parts of their workforce, or move operations closer to home through reshoring, nearshoring, or friendshoring. An analysis of the responses to these questions for the subset of employers who expect geoeconomic trends to affect their business provides insight into how these trends affect workforce decisions. Table 2.1 shows the share of employers who expect each geoeconomic trend to transform their business that additionally also expect to offshore or re-shore significant segments of their workforce. All three geoeconomic trends analysed appear to drive more re-shoring, with respondents who expect their business to be transformed by increasing restrictions to global trade and investment 50% more likely to plan to reshore than the global average employer. Employers who expect government subsidies and industrial policy to transform their business, however, are almost as likely to plan to offshore as they are to reshore

## Green transition

Climate change adaptation is expected to be the third-largest contributor to net growth in global jobs by 2030, projected to contribute an additional 5 million net jobs, while climate-change mitigation comes in 6th with an additional 3 million net jobs. Trends in energy generation, storage and distribution, meanwhile, are expected to create an additional 1 million net jobs – the second-largest technology-based contribution to net job growth (after trends in AI and information processing technology).

Expectations around climate-change adaptation and mitigation trends are pushing Environmental

Engineers and Renewable Energy Engineers into the top 15 fastest-growing jobs, as well as driving growth in roles such as Sustainability Specialists and Renewable Energy Technicians. This is corroborated by evidence that “green hiring” has consistently outperformed overall labour-market hiring trends in recent years (Box 2.1).

Both green transition-related macrotrends are also expected to drive some of the largest labour-market transformation, in absolute terms, in the global economy. This includes being the largest drivers of both job growth and decline in Farmworkers, Labourers, and Other Agricultural Workers as well as being among the strongest drivers of net job growth for Building Framers, Finishers and Related Trades Workers.

### BOX 2.1 Green hiring rates

In collaboration with LinkedIn

LinkedIn data, generated up to July 2024 for the *Future of Jobs Report 2025*, assesses the progression of green hiring rates compared to overall hiring rates. By comparing the share of LinkedIn members with green skills being hired with the overall hiring rate, it is possible to assess differences in employment outcomes between these two groups.

Figure B2.1 shows that LinkedIn members with green skills are being hired at a significantly higher rate than other members. Despite a dip in green hiring throughout 2021 and early 2022, green hiring has consistently outperformed the overall hiring, and this outperformance has been consistently getting larger since its low point of May 2022.

## Demographic shifts

Growing working-age populations are the macrotrend expected to be the second-biggest driver of global net job creation – with 9 million net additional jobs by 2030 – surpassed only by broadening digital access. Aging and declining working-age populations, meanwhile, are simultaneously expected to be, overall, the third-largest driver of job creation (11 million additional jobs) as well the primary factor in a global reduction in 7 million jobs, making this trend the 5th largest driver of net job creation, on balance, resulting in 4 million net additional jobs by 2030.

These two demographic trends are notably among the top three drivers of growth in roles for Assembly and Factory Workers and Vocational Education Teachers. Aging and declining working-age populations also appear to drive growth in roles for Nurses, Sales and Hospitality professionals as well as being among the largest drivers of growth for shop salespersons, wholesale and manufacturing sales representatives, food and beverage serving workers and food processing and related trades workers. Growing working age populations, meanwhile, are expected to be a key driver of growth for Education roles, including University and Higher Education Teachers and Secondary Education Teachers.

## Economic uncertainty

Slower economic growth is the only macrotrend that Future of Jobs Survey respondents expect to drive more job destruction (3 million jobs) than creation (2 million jobs), while rising cost of living and higher prices are expected to drive job creation of 4 million jobs and displacement of 3 million jobs by 2030.

These two trends are both significant contributors to an expected decline in roles for Building Caretakers, Cleaners, and Housekeepers, while slower economic growth is also among the top contributors to job decline in Business Services and Administration Managers, General and Operations Managers, and Sales and Marketing Professionals.

However, slower economic growth is also projected to be a top driver for growth in roles such as Business Development Professionals and Sales Representatives. Growth in roles driven by increasing cost of living is concentrated in jobs associated with finding ways of increasing efficiency, such as AI and Machine Learning Specialists, Business Development Professionals, and Supply Chain and Logistics Specialists.

# Skills outlook

This chapter presents the results of the Future of Jobs Survey concerning skills, as classified by the World Economic Forum's Global Skills Taxonomy.<sup>36</sup> It begins by analysing respondents' expectations of skill disruption by 2030, as well as the skills currently required for work and whether employers anticipate these skills will increase or decrease in importance over the next five years. The chapter then assesses the skills expected to become core

skills by 2030, based on their current significance and anticipated evolution. It also contrasts the skills required for growing and declining jobs, revealing windows of opportunity for enabling dynamic job transitions. Finally, it offers an overview of the key drivers of skill transformation and concludes with an exploration of anticipated training needs and trends.

## 3.1 Expected disruptions to skills

When the Future of Jobs Report was first published in 2016, surveyed employers expected that 35% of workers' skills would face disruption in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with rapid advancements in frontier technologies, led to significant disruptions in working life and skills, prompting respondents to predict high levels of skills instability in subsequent editions of the report. The post-pandemic period, however, has seen employers adapt to these changes. The accelerated adoption of digital tools, remote work solutions, and advanced technologies such as machine learning and generative AI provided companies with relevant experience to better understand the critical skills required to navigate rapid technological change.

Despite current uncertainty around the long-term impact of generative AI, the expected ongoing pace of disruption of skills has begun to stabilize, albeit at a high level. Overall, employers expect 39% of workers' core skills to change by 2030 (Figure 3.1). While this represents significant ongoing skill disruption, it is down from 44% in 2023. One element contributing to this finding may be a growing focus on continuous learning, upskilling and reskilling programmes, enabling companies to better anticipate and manage future skill requirements. This is reflected in an increasing share of the workforce (50%) having completing training as part of long-term learning strategies compared to 2023 (41%) – a finding that is consistent across almost all industries. This is discussed further in section 3.3.

Note

Values reported are the mean skill stability percentages estimated by employers surveyed in each edition of the survey.

However, the extent of skills disruption is not uniform across economies and industries. Lower-middle and upper middle-income economies and

those affected by conflict tend to expect greater disruption in workers' skills, while high-income economies foresee less instability (Figure 3.2).

Note

The Future of Jobs Survey uses the World Economic Forum's Global Skills Taxonomy.

## Core skills

Figure 3.3 shows the core skills Future of Jobs Survey respondents identify as required by workers today. As in the two previous editions of this report, analytical thinking remains the top core skill for employers, with seven out of 10 companies considering it as essential. This is followed by resilience, flexibility and agility, along with leadership and social influence, underscoring the critical role of adaptability and collaboration alongside cognitive skills. Creative thinking and motivation and self-awareness rank fourth and fifth, respectively. This combination of cognitive, self-efficacy and interpersonal skills within the top five emphasizes the importance ascribed by respondents to having an agile, innovative and collaborative workforce, where both problem-solving abilities and personal resilience are critical for success.

The top 10 core skills are complemented by

technological literacy, empathy and active listening, curiosity and lifelong learning, talent management, and service orientation and customer service. Skills that reflect the important role of technical proficiency, strong interpersonal abilities, emotional intelligence, and a commitment to continuous learning demonstrate respondents' expectation that workers must balance hard and soft skills to thrive in today's work environments.

While the core skill sets are relatively consistent across broader industries and geographical regions, there are notable distinctions within specific sectors and geographies. For instance, the Insurance and Pensions Management industry places a significantly higher value on curiosity and lifelong learning, with 83% of respondents identifying it as a core skill compared to the global average of 50%. Resilience, flexibility and agility are also considered as especially crucial in this sector, with 94% of respondents emphasizing their importance versus a global average of 67%.

{35}------------------------------------------------

The Mining and Metals industry distinguishes itself with a strong focus on environmental stewardship, as 50% of respondents view it as a core skill – 2.5 times the global average. This emphasis on environmental skills is also evident in the Government and Public Sector, where it is double the global average. Additionally, both the Mining and Metals and Advanced Manufacturing industries place higher importance on manual dexterity, endurance and precision skills compared to other sectors, with roughly 25% of respondents identifying this as a core skill.

The Telecommunications industry stands out for prioritizing design and user experience, networks and cybersecurity, and programming skills, with twice the global average of respondents considering these as core skills in their organizations. Similarly, the Information

and Technology Services sector places greater emphasis on programming skills.

Compared to the 2023 edition of this report, some significant shifts in core skills have emerged. Leadership and social influence, AI and big data, talent management, and service orientation and customer service have all seen marked increases in relevance. Conversely, skills like dependability, attention to detail, and quality control have decreased in importance for organizations compared to the 2023 data.

Overall, leadership and social influence, resilience, flexibility and agility, and AI and big data have seen the most substantial increase in importance, with 22, 17, and 17 percentage-point rises, respectively, in the share of respondents identifying them as core skills compared to the 2023 edition of the report.

## Skill evolution

According to employer expectations for the evolution of skills in the next five years, as shown in Figure 3.4, technological skills are projected to grow in importance more rapidly than any other type of skills. Among these, **AI and big data** top the list as the fastest-growing skills, followed closely by **networks and cybersecurity** and **technological literacy**. Complementing these technological skills, creative thinking and two socio-emotional attitudes – **resilience, flexibility, and agility**, along with **curiosity and lifelong learning** – are also seen as rising in importance.

Also ranking among the top 10 skills on the rise are leadership and social influence, talent management, analytical thinking, and environmental stewardship. These skills highlight the need for workers who can lead teams, manage talent effectively and adapt to sustainability and green transitions in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.

At the other end of the spectrum, respondents identified sensory-processing abilities; reading, writing and mathematics; dependability and attention to detail; quality control; and global citizenship as among the most stable skills. However, a small net decline is anticipated in reading, writing, and mathematics. Manual

{37}------------------------------------------------

dexterity, endurance, and precision stands out with a notable anticipated net decline, with 24% of respondents foreseeing a decrease in its importance. The declining relevance of physical abilities has been a trend in previous *Future of Jobs Reports*, but this is the first time it has seen a net negative decline.

Comparisons with previous editions of the Future of Jobs Survey reveal a notable shift in skill demands, with technology skills such as AI and big data, networks and cybersecurity, and environmental stewardship showing the largest net increase in the share of respondents identifying them as critical for the next five years. Conversely, skills like reading, writing, and mathematics; manual dexterity, endurance, and precision; and dependability and attention to detail have seen the largest decline in projected future demand.

Figure 3.5 illustrates industry-specific variations in the evolving importance of skills. AI and big data are predicted to see significant growth across nearly all sectors. In the top 10 industries, over 90% of respondents expect this skill to increase in use. The lowest growth shares are observed in Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (70%) and Accommodation, Food, and Leisure industries (69%). This highlights a broad-based but uneven embrace of advanced technological skills across industries.

Resilience, flexibility and agility are growing in demand more quickly in the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing; Telecommunications; and Information and Technology Services sectors. The Insurance and Pensions Management industry stands out as the industry forecasting the fastest growth in importance in creative thinking skills. This industry, along with Education and Training and Telecommunications forecast fast growth in the importance of curiosity and lifelong learning.

Increasing skill demands in environmental stewardship skills are particularly evident in the Oil and Gas and Chemical and Advanced Materials industries.

Furthermore, the net decline in the demand for manual dexterity, endurance, and precision skills is observed across sectors, with the most significant decreases in Energy Technology and Utilities, Chemicals and Advanced Materials, and Information Technology Services, each experiencing declines exceeding 39%. By contrast, the Accommodation, Food, and Leisure sector and the Automotive and Aerospace industries show the smallest declines, with net reductions below 14%.

## Core skills in 2030

Looking ahead to 2030, Figure 3.6 provides further insights into key priority areas for workforce development for organizations, by comparing core and emerging skills by 2030 based on their relative importance today and their future evolution. The top right quadrant highlights skills that are already core to organizations today and are expected to continue growing rapidly. Skills such as **AI and big data; analytical thinking; creative thinking; resilience, flexibility and agility; and technological literacy** are not only considered critical now but are also projected to become even more important. Moreover, **leadership and social influence,**

**curiosity and lifelong learning, systems thinking, talent management, and motivation and self-awareness** solidify their importance, emphasizing the continued relevance of human-centric skills amid rapid technological advances.

Meanwhile, **networks and cybersecurity and environmental stewardship** – in the top left quadrant of the figure – rank among the top 10 skills expected to increase significantly in use by 2030, yet they are not currently considered core skills for most organizations. These emerging skills represent areas where businesses may need to anticipate growing demands and develop capabilities before they become critical.

{40}------------------------------------------------

On the other hand, skills that are core today, but expected to remain stable over the next five years without significant increase in use, displayed in the lower right quadrant, include empathy and active listening, service orientation and customer service and resource management and operations. Finally, the bottom left quadrant of Figure 3.6 highlights

skills that are neither critical now nor expected to increase significantly in use over the next five years. While most of these skills remain important, they may represent areas where less investment is required, allowing employers to prioritize resources toward more rapidly evolving skill sets.

### Skill differences between growing and declining jobs

While a diverse set of skills is essential for navigating the evolving workforce landscape, contrasting the skills requirements particularly associated with growing jobs, and those associated with declining ones, reveals windows of opportunity that exist for enabling dynamic job transitions.<sup>37,38</sup> Figure 3.7 illustrates these differences based on two metrics derived from the O\*NET skills inventory:<sup>39</sup> the “importance gap”, which measures how much more essential a skill is for growing jobs, and the “proficiency gap”, which indicates the level of

expertise required for each skill in growing jobs compared to declining jobs. For example, a score of 2 in either metric means a skill is twice as critical or requires double the proficiency in growing roles.

{41}------------------------------------------------

FIGURE 3.7 Skill importance gap and skill proficiency gap between growing and declining jobs

When growing and declining job roles attach the same level of importance and proficiency to a skill, the index equals one. The bigger the value, the bigger the gap between growing and declining jobs.

World Economy Forum analysis, based on Future of Jobs Survey 2024, the World Economic Forum's Global Skills Taxonomy and O\*NET skill importance and level for each occupation.

Note

Bold lines represent the average across all skills.

At an aggregate level across all growing and declining roles, resilience, flexibility and agility skills are the most significant differentiator between growing and declining job roles, ranking higher in both importance and proficiency for growing roles. Programming and technological literacy also differentiates growing and declining roles, reflecting the increasing integration of technology across occupational fields. While programming scores higher in importance, it requires less proficiency compared to technological literacy.

Resource management and operations, and quality control skills also show marked gaps in both proficiency and importance. Analytical thinking completes the list of top five skills for the importance gap, while ranking 6th for the skill proficiency gap.

Manual dexterity, endurance, and precision display a notable difference in proficiency requirements

rather than importance. This suggests that in roles in which manual skills remain critical, businesses are seeking a higher degree of specialization that combines manual abilities with technological literacy, and problem-solving skills. Growing roles demanding high manual skill proficiency include Drafters, Engineering and Mapping Technicians, Electrotechnology Engineers, Mechanics, Machinery Repairers, and Solar Energy Installation Engineers. By contrast, declining roles, such as printing trades workers and transportation attendants, generally require lower levels of manual skill proficiency. Notably, the only skill with an equal or lesser requirement in importance or proficiency for growing jobs is service orientation and customer service.

These findings underscore the importance of targeted skills development efforts to support workers in transitioning to growing roles as well as to ensure employers can access a talent pool with the skills required for the future of work.

## 3.2 Drivers of skill disruption

This section discusses how each of the five identified macrotrends driving labour-market transformation – technological change, geoeconomic fragmentation, green transition, demographic shifts and economic uncertainty – are expected to influence skill evolution by 2030.

### Technological change

Technological advances are expected to drive skills change more than any other trend over the next five years. The increasing importance of AI and big data, networks and cybersecurity, and technological literacy is driven by the expansion of digital access and the integration of AI and information processing technologies. These trends are not only seen as responsible for the growth of these three fastest-growing skills but also for the rising importance of analytical thinking and systems thinking. These shifts highlight the increasing complexity of decision-making and the need for critical problem solving in a data-driven world.

Beyond the top 10 fastest-growing skills, design and user experience, along with marketing and media skills, are also expected to see growth driven by technological advancements. These skills are closely linked to digital transformation, reflecting the rising importance of delivering seamless digital experiences and understanding the impact of consumer behaviour.

Robots and autonomous systems are also seen as a key driver of skills change, contributing to the increased demand for not only the three top-growing skills, but also programming and systems thinking – skills essential for managing and optimizing interactions with autonomous technology. As noted in Chapter 2, robots and autonomous systems are also among the primary drivers behind the fastest-growing jobs. Coupled with the rising demand for the three top growing

skills, and programming, this trend underscores the importance of technological expertise and systems thinking as core skills in technical fields. These capabilities are crucial for enabling employees to adapt to, and collaborate effectively with, automated systems across a range of industries.

While technology fuels demand for certain skills, it also accelerates the decline of others. Skills such as manual dexterity, endurance, precision, and reading, writing, and mathematics are expected to diminish in relevance as digital access, AI and information processing, and robotics increasingly automate these tasks. Interestingly, whereas programming remains stable as an in-demand skill, both respondents expecting growth in its use and those expecting decline consistently point to technological change as the primary driver behind this change. As discussed in more depth in Chapter 2, this highlights the dual effect of technology, underscoring how the same technological forces that drive job creation may also contribute to job displacement. Additionally, as also discussed in Chapter 2, the primary impact of technologies such as GenAI on skills may lie in their potential for “augmenting” human skills through human-machine collaboration, rather than in outright replacement, particularly given the continued importance of human-centred skills (Box 3.1).

These findings underscore an urgent need for appropriate reskilling and upskilling strategies to bridge emerging divides. Such strategies will be essential in helping workers transition to roles that blend technical expertise with human-centred capabilities, supporting a more adaptable workforce in an increasingly technology-driven landscape.

#### BOX 3.1 Generative AI and human-centred skills

In collaboration with Indeed

The release of ChatGPT 3.5 in November 2022 marked an inflection point in public awareness of GenAI technologies, which sparked both excitement and apprehension regarding their potential impact on the workforce.<sup>40</sup> In this context, research conducted by Indeed for this report highlights the continued importance of human-centred skills in an age of GenAI. Figure B3.1 illustrates the capacity of GenAI to substitute a human in executing specific skills, based on an assessment by GPT-4o of its own ability to utilize skills across three areas: its ability to provide theoretical knowledge about a given skill, its

problem-solving abilities related to that skill, and the need for physical presence or manual actions in performing that skill.<sup>41</sup> The chart categorizes more than 2,800 granular skills into the World Economic Forum's Global Skills Taxonomy and evaluates their capacity of substitution by GenAI according to five categories: very low capacity, low capacity, moderate capacity, high capacity, and very high capacity.

Zero of the more than 2,800 skills assessed were determined to exhibit “very high capacity” to be replaced by the current generation of GenAI

{43}------------------------------------------------

tools, with the majority of examined skills (69%) determined to have either “very low capacity” or “low capacity” to be substituted, indicating that GenAI currently remains limited in performing tasks that require physical execution, nuanced judgment or hands-on application. Skills rooted in human interaction – including empathy and active listening, and sensory processing abilities – and manual dexterity, endurance and precision, currently show no substitution potential due to their physical and deeply human components. These findings underscore the practical limitations of current GenAI models, which lack the physicality to perform tasks that require hands-on interaction – although advances in robotics and the integration of GenAI into robotic systems could impact this in the future.

Where GenAI demonstrates higher substitution potential is in skills that can be effectively performed by leveraging theoretical knowledge alongside digital manipulation. These include granular skills within AI and big data, such as data mining and machine learning applications.

Furthermore, GenAI shows strengths in reading, writing, and mathematics, and multi-lingualism, where it can assist in summarizing complex information, drafting text, performing calculations, and translation. Notably, more than one-quarter (28.5%) of the more than 2,800 granular skills examined currently exhibit a moderate capacity of substitution, highlighting areas where, as the technology continues to evolve, its capacity of substitution could increase in the near future.

These findings highlight the potential of GenAI for augmenting human work through human-machine collaboration, rather than fully replacing it in most areas. Skills requiring nuanced understanding, complex problem-solving or sensory processing show limited current risk of replacement by GenAI, affirming that human oversight remains crucial even in areas where GenAI can provide assistance. For employers, these insights emphasize the need for training and upskilling initiatives that focus on both advanced prompt-writing skills and broader GenAI literacy.

## Geoeconomic fragmentation and economic uncertainty

The Future of Jobs Survey also examined the impact of geoeconomic trends on skill evolution. Increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, coupled with the rapid adoption of new technologies and expansion of digital access, has significantly increased cybersecurity concerns.<sup>42</sup> These geoeconomic trends have led to a surge in demand for network and cybersecurity skills as organizations seek to protect digital infrastructure from emerging threats.

Geoeconomic fragmentation is also driving a need for human-centred skills such as resilience, flexibility, agility, leadership and social influence, and global citizenship. In a world where crises are becoming more frequent, employers need leaders and teams capable of adapting to uncertainty and managing complex social dynamics.

Slower economic growth and increased restrictions to global trade are contributing to the increased importance of creative thinking and resilience, flexibility, and agility. These skills are crucial for navigating uncertain economic landscapes, as businesses seek to innovate and remain competitive despite market constraints.

### Green transition

A growing focus on environmental stewardship as a critical skill reflects an evolving alignment between business strategies and sustainability objectives. This rise, driven by climate adaptation efforts, carbon reduction initiatives, and energy generation, storage and distribution technologies, points to a profound shift whereby environmental skills are becoming increasingly integral across diverse sectors. As previously shown in Chapter 2 and Box 2.1, an increasing prioritization of climate adaptation and energy solutions by employers responding

to the Future of Jobs Survey is not only evident in skill requirements but also appears as a significant factor in net job growth by 2030.

While demand for global citizenship skills is expected by most respondents to remain stable over the next five years, employers that anticipate a rise in its importance cite the convergence of climate-change adaptation, geoeconomic fragmentation and broadening digital access as key factors. This highlights the growing interconnectedness of sustainability and global collaboration, particularly as businesses operate in increasingly fragmented and climate-sensitive environments.

### Demographic shifts

Ongoing demographic shifts, particularly aging and declining workforces in developed economies, are expected to emerge as a significant driver of skill demand. Aging and declining working-age populations are pressing organizations to prioritize talent management, teaching and mentoring and motivation and self-awareness. Alongside these priorities, there is a rising focus on empathy and active listening, resource management, and customer service, highlighting a growing need for interpersonal and operational skills that can address the specific needs of an aging workforce and foster more inclusive work environments.

Increasing demand for talent management and motivation and self-awareness skills is also driven by growing working-age populations. Findings reported in Chapter 2 underscore similar patterns, where aging and growing working-age populations are major drivers of growth in jobs across Education, Sales, and Hospitality. These trends reveal the dual role demographic changes play in shaping both job availability and the types of skills needed, emphasizing the interconnectedness of workforce demographics with skills development and talent strategies across sectors.

## 3.3 Reskilling and upskilling strategies

Having anticipated significant skill disruptions, employers have increasingly invested in reskilling and upskilling initiatives to align workforce skills with evolving demands (see Section 3.1).

This section explores training trends, how employers expect to finance their training initiatives, and their expectations regarding the outcomes of these investments.

### Training needs

Future of Jobs Survey respondents indicate that

50% of their workforce has completed training as part of their learning and development initiatives. This reflects a positive global trend compared to 2023, when only 41% of the workforce had received training. The rise in training completion is evident across nearly all industries (Figure 3.8), suggesting a growing recognition of the importance of continuous skill development.

However, a few industries stand out from this trend. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, and Real Estate are the only sectors that have seen a decline in training completion between the two last editions of this report. On the other hand, industries like Insurance and Pensions Management, Supply

{46}------------------------------------------------

Chain and Transportation and Telecommunications have seen the most significant rise in the share of workers completing training.

Looking ahead, Figure 3.9 provides an overview of expectations around workforce training needs by 2030. According to surveyed employers, for a representative sample of 100 workers 41 will not require significant training by 2030; 11 will require training, but it will not be accessible to them in the foreseeable future; and 29 will require training and be upskilled within their current roles. Additionally, employers anticipate that 19 out of 100 workers will require training and will be reskilled and redeployed within their organization by 2030.

The anticipated need for training varies significantly across industries and geographies. While companies headquartered in North America estimate that 67% of their workforce will require training by 2030, those in Central Asia and the

Middle East and North Africa project that under 50% of their workforce will need training by 2030.

Industries, such as Telecommunications, and Information and Technology Services, which saw some of the largest uptake in reskilling and upskilling (Figure 3.8), still anticipate significant training needs, with 63% and 62% of their workforce, respectively, expected to need further training by 2030. By contrast, sectors with declining trendlines in training completion are among the sectors with the lowest projected additional training needs.

The share of employees estimated as unlikely to receive upskilling opportunities is somewhat uniform across industries and geographies, suggesting that while the demand for skills may vary, access to reskilling and upskilling opportunities remains similarly constrained globally.

| Would be upskilled in their current role              | 29                         |
| Would be upskilled and re-deployed                    | 19                         |
| Would be unlikely to receive the necessary upskilling | 11                         |

## Funding for training programmes

When it comes to funding of reskilling and upskilling initiatives, employers predominantly expect to fund their own training programmes, as shown in Figure 3.10. The second-most common funding mechanism is free of cost training, followed by government and public-private funding.

With funding for reskilling and upskilling being the most-welcomed public-policy support by Future of Jobs Survey respondents, government funding plays a more significant role in industries such as Accommodation, Food, and Leisure; Government

and Public Sector; and Education and Training, where over 30% of companies expect to rely on public financing for training initiatives. On the other hand, only 3% of companies in the Insurance and Pensions Management industry expect to rely on government funding for training.

While co-funding across industries is the least utilized funding model overall, it is expected to have the largest use in industries such as Care, Personal Services and Wellbeing; Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing; and Automotive and Aerospace. This highlights the importance of cross industry collaboration in these industries.

The most common outcomes employers expect from their investment in training are enhanced productivity (cited by 77% of respondents) and improved competitiveness (70%). Talent retention ranks as the third-most important expected outcome of training programmes, though it plays

a more central role in sectors such as Automotive and Aerospace, Electronics, and Production of Consumer Goods, where over 72% of employers highlight this as a key priority (Figure 3.11).

# Workforce strategies

This chapter discusses workforce strategies that employers anticipate adopting in response to the macrotrends shaping the future of work and key barriers to organizational transformation. It also analyses employers' outlook on talent availability

from now to 2030, and explores planned workplace practices and policies to achieve their organization's business goals, with a particular focus on the shifting relationship between humans and technologies.

## 4.1 Barriers to transformation

Skill gaps in the labour market are the primary barrier to business transformation perceived by Future of Jobs Survey respondents for the 2025-2030 period, cited by 63% of surveyed employers (Figure 4.1). This is even more pronounced than the results described in the 2023 edition of the

report, where skills gaps in the local labour market also topped the transformation barriers, backed by 60% of executives. This skill challenge persists across almost all industries and geographies, ranking first in 52 out of 55 economies and 19 out of 22 sectors.

FIGURE 4.1 Barriers to organizational transformation, 2025-2030

Share of employers surveyed expecting the stated barrier will hinder their organisational transformation.

| 1. Skills gaps in the labour market                   | 63% |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| 2. Organizational culture and resistance to change    | 46% |
| 3. Outdated or inflexible regulatory framework        | 39% |
| 4. Inability to attract talent to the industry        | 37% |
| 5. Lack of adequate data and technical infrastructure | 32% |
| 6. Inability to attract talent to my firm             | 27% |
| 7. Shortage of investment capital                     | 26% |
| 8. Insufficient understanding of opportunities        | 25% |

The second most significant perceived barrier is organizational culture and resistance to change, identified by 46% of respondents as a key obstacle, which highlights the anticipated challenge of aligning internal processes, organizational structures, hierarchies and mindsets in responding to the trends and disruptions companies expect to face. Regulatory concerns

are considered the third most relevant barrier, identified by 39% of employers. Moreover, 32% of respondents highlight a lack of adequate data and technical infrastructure as an additional obstacle. Other barriers, such as shortage of investment capital (26%) and insufficient understanding of opportunities (25%), are cited less frequently.

{49}------------------------------------------------

In the report's 2023 edition, more than half of respondents identified difficulties in attracting talent as a primary barrier. This year's survey distinguishes between industry attractiveness and firm-level attractiveness, and results show that 37% of companies view lack of industry attractiveness as a notable barrier, while 27% cite firm-specific issues.

## Talent availability outlook

Employers' outlook on talent availability has decreased compared to the results highlighted in the report's 2023 edition. This year, only 29% of businesses expect talent availability to improve over the 2025-2030 period, a drop from 39% in 2023. By contrast, 42% of employers expect talent availability to decline over this period, resulting in a net negative talent availability outlook (-13%).

net expectation of improvement) and highlighting increasing concern among businesses regarding their ability to find the right future talent (Figure 4.2).

However, employers remain more broadly optimistic about the outlook for talent development. Seven in 10 respondents expect improvements in talent development within their organization by 2030. However, as noted in the report's 2023 edition, 77% of businesses expressed a positive view on the outlook for talent development, suggesting that some companies are re-evaluating their expectations.

With regard to talent retention, employers are similarly less positive than in the report's previous edition: Only 44% of surveyed organizations expect improvements in their ability to retain talent, a decline from 53% two years ago.

Country-specific variations in talent availability outlook, as shown for hiring in Figure 4.3, reflect broader demographic dynamics. For example, in the Middle East and North Africa, employers in countries such as Egypt (+39% net expectation of improvement), Morocco (+38%), and Bahrain (+31%) display high levels of optimism about talent availability, with the majority of respondents expecting hiring conditions to improve by 2030. By contrast, employers in European economies anticipate increasing challenges in hiring availability.

Expectations around talent development shows significant regional variation. For example, companies headquartered in Eastern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia generally report high levels of optimism for the next five years. By contrast, businesses headquartered in Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa, and Northern America are more cautious than global averages with regard to their expectations.

As for talent retention, employers in high-income and upper-middle-income economies express greater concern compared to their counterparts in lower-middle-income economies.

## Workforce strategy

Upskilling the workforce emerges as the most common workforce strategy in response to macrotrends, over the 2025-2030 period, with 85% of surveyed employers anticipating adopting this approach (Figure 4.4). Upskilling is identified as a top 3 priority across all geographies, and economies at all income levels, with employers in high-income economies (87%) slightly ahead of those in upper-middle-income (84%) and lower-middle-income (82%) ones.

Process and task automation is expected to be the second most common workforce strategy, with 73% of employers planning to accelerate their use of this approach – down from 80% as

noted in the report's 2023 edition. Additionally, 63% of employers intend to complement and augment their workforce with new technologies. Automation is a more pronounced strategy in high-income economies (77%), compared to upper-middle-income (74%) and lower-middle-income economies (57%).

Regarding adjusting the composition of their workforce, 70% of organizations surveyed plan to hire new staff with emerging in-demand skills, 51% intend to transition staff from declining to growing roles internally, while 41% foresee staff reductions due to skills obsolescence. A slightly higher share of employers plan to move operations within closer control through reshoring, nearshoring or friendshoring (10%) than those who plan to offshore significant parts of their workforce (8%).

## 4.2 Improving talent availability

### Business practices

The importance of supporting employee health and well-being has newly emerged as a top priority to increase talent availability over the 2025-2030 period. As shown in Figure 4.5, 64% of employers now see promise in this approach, a marked rise from 9th place in the 2023 edition of this report to 1st this year. In fact, this newfound emphasis on this practice holds importance across industries, ranking first in eight sectors and consistently within the top four across all others. In the Insurance and Pensions Management sector, 85% of companies expect this practice to improve talent availability.

The Accommodation, Food, and Leisure, and Education and Training sectors witnessed the largest jump in prioritizing employee well-being between 2023 and 2025.

Additional business practices identified as promising to increase talent availability include providing effective reskilling and upskilling opportunities<sup>43</sup>, highlighted by 63% of organizations, this is particularly evident in the Government and Public sector, where four out of five respondents expect such measures to grow their talent base. Following closely behind, improving talent progression and promotion, previously ranked highest in the 2023 edition, remains a key focus for 62% of surveyed organizations. Higher wages are identified as a

priority by 50% of respondents, with particular significance in the Education and Training sector, where 61% of employers emphasize this measure.

Tapping into diverse talent pools continues to increase in importance, with almost half of surveyed employers (47%) now emphasizing the potential of this strategy – a substantial increase from just over 10% in the report's 2023 edition. These findings highlight the potential of skills-first approaches in identifying and attracting talent based on skills rather than traditional credentials.<sup>44</sup> In line with this, employers also show increased interest in offering flexibility measures, such as enabling remote work

across national borders (27%) and supporting workers with caregiving responsibilities (26%).

By contrast, articulating business purpose and impact has seen a decline in emphasis, dropping from 4th place in the report's 2023 edition, with 37% of employers highlighting the promise of this measure.

#### BOX 4.1 **Talent availability: an employee perspective**

In collaboration with ADP Research

To complement the Future of Jobs Survey's focus on employer perspectives on talent availability, collaboration for this report with ADP Research has produced a data set that provides the employee perspective, aiming to understand the key factors and priorities that would make workers want to stay in a job. The resulting analysis reveals both convergences and divergences in priorities for talent attraction and retention (Figure B4.1).

Where employees' reasons to stay and employers' practices align include: improving talent progression and promotion processes (employer rank 3rd vs. employee rank 2nd), offering higher wages (employer rank 4th vs. employee rank 3rd), and providing remote or hybrid work opportunities (employer 6th vs. employee 4th).

The findings also highlight areas of misalignment between employee and employer expectations. The divergence is most pronounced around

supporting health and well-being and upskilling and reskilling, which are viewed as essential by employers, but less so by employees, who rank them 8th and 7th, respectively. By contrast, employees place higher value on working hours, which tops the list of desired policies, while employers rank this measure the eighth most effective strategy to boost talent availability; and

pension policies, which rank 5th for employees – 10 places higher than for employers.

Both employees and employers placed less emphasis on supporting workers with caregiving responsibilities and articulating business purpose and social impact.

ADP Research and World Economic Forum analysis.

Note

In the ADP Research survey, the question is framed as follows: From the following list, which are the top three (perks) reasons you stay with your current employer? The options were matched with the list of business practices to boost talent availability in the Future of Jobs Survey.

## Public policies

Globally, when asked about the public-policy interventions with the highest perceived potential to increase access to talent over the 2025-2030 period, employers identified funding for reskilling and upskilling (55%) and provision of reskilling and upskilling (52%) as the two most crucial policy measures (Figure 4.6). This points to businesses' desire for sustained public investment in skills development to align workforce capabilities with future labour-market demands.

Improving public education systems has risen in perceived priority and now ranks 3rd, with 47% of respondents highlighting this policy measure, up from 4th in the report's 2023 edition. In Israel, Kazakhstan and the Philippines, public education system improvements saw the largest increase in priority as a public policy measure to enhance talent availability, rising seven, six, and six places, respectively, compared to 2023. Simultaneously,

wage-setting flexibility has moved to 5th place globally, up from 6th in 2023, with 38% of respondents highlighting this policy measure.

Wage subsidies saw the biggest decline in perceived importance, moving from 3rd in 2023 to 8th in this year's edition, with 26% of respondents pointing to it as a critical policy tool. Flexibility in hiring and firing practices, ranked 4th, has declined two places since 2023, now highlighted by 44% of employers. Despite the overall decline in emphasis on this measure, wage subsidies remain the top highlighted policy in Türkiye and Morocco, while hiring and firing flexibility is the most emphasized priority in eleven countries, including Australia, Brazil, Republic of Korea and Singapore.

In light of demographic shifts, companies are increasingly exploring policy interventions aimed at broadening the talent pool. Changes to labour laws related to remote work are highlighted as a priority by 36% of employers, with strong demand in particular from companies headquartered in

{54}------------------------------------------------

Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as, from an industry perspective, in the finance industry (both Financial Services and Capital markets and Insurance and Pensions Management). Changes to immigration laws (26%) are less emphasized, with the exception of industries such as Production of Consumer Goods; Accommodation, Food, and Leisure; and Electronics. Meanwhile, a quarter of respondents

(25%) highlight changes to pension schemes and retirement ages. Companies headquartered in Eastern Asia, where the effect of ageing workforces is currently more pronounced, favour this public policy. By contrast, few organizations headquartered in regions with younger populations, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, see the potential of such policy intervention.

## Diversity, equity and inclusion

Globally, the Future of Jobs Survey finds increased emphasis by employers on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace, connected to a growing perception of its potential to increase talent availability. Tapping into diverse talent pools is now considered among the top 5 most impactful business practices to increase talent availability, compared to its 11th place ranking in the report's 2023 edition.

Eighty-three percent of surveyed employers have implemented diversity, equity and inclusion measures, an increase from 67% in 2023. This trend is especially strong among larger organizations, where nearly all companies with over 50,000 employees (95%) and those headquartered in Northern America (96%) report having such measures in place. By contrast, companies headquartered in lower-middle-income economies (75%) and smaller organizations (73%) are less likely to implement diversity, equity and inclusion measures.

As shown in Figure 4.7, 51% of employers plan to run diversity, equity and inclusion trainings for managers and staff, which remains the most

common such programme element anticipated to be implemented by organizations in the next five years. This is closely followed by targeted recruitment, retention and progression initiatives (48%), with diversity, equity and inclusion goals, targets and quotas (42%) experiencing the fastest growth in anticipated adoption. In the report's 2023 edition, only one-quarter of companies had planned to adopt such targets (Figure 4.8). Pay equity reviews and salary audits, anti-harassment protocols and support for workers with caregiving responsibilities are also increasingly highlighted, with 39%, 33% and 26% of companies, respectively, planning to adopt these measures. Hiring diversity, equity and inclusion officers and supporting employee resource groups (ERGs) are less commonly mentioned, adopted by 15% and 22% of surveyed organizations, respectively.

Geographic differences persist. For example, as shown in Table 4.1, companies headquartered in the Middle East and Northern Africa are less likely to engage in pay equity reviews (23%), while those in

Latin America and the Caribbean are more inclined to implement anti-harassment protocols (54%). In Northern America, a significantly higher share (42%) of employers anticipates setting up ERGs.

In terms of employee demographics, women are considered the highest priority group for surveyed employers' diversity, equity and inclusion programmes worldwide, with 76% of respondents anticipating a focus of their measures on this group (Figure 4.9). Workers with disabilities (56%) and 'Gen Z' youth (those under the age of 25) (52%) are the second- and third most considered groups. Older workers (those over the age of 55) and those identifying as LGBTQI+ are anticipated to be a

focus for 42% and 33% of surveyed employers, respectively. Finally, 27% of respondents anticipate a focus on individuals from disadvantaged religious, ethnic, or racial backgrounds. This represents a decline from the report's 2023 edition, when nearly two-fifths of employers expected to be focusing on individuals from these groups. Workers from low-income backgrounds (24%) and migrants, refugees and displaced workers (21%) are the least commonly mentioned groups.

## Wages

As the labour market experiences shifts in workforce dynamics due to macrotrends such as technological change, demographic shifts and economic uncertainty, wage dynamics have become an increasingly important factor for

understanding the shape of future labour markets. As revealed by the Future of Jobs Survey, more than half (52%) of employers globally expect to see an increase in the share of their revenue allocated to wages over the 2025-2030 period, 41% of surveyed employers anticipate their current wage allocation to remain stable, while 7% foresee a reduction by 2030 (Figure 4.10).

Smaller companies exhibit higher expectations regarding growth of wages as a share of total revenues, with 57% of employers with fewer than 1,000 employees anticipating an increase in wage share. By contrast, only 45% of employers with 10,000-50,000 employees and 47% of those with over 50,000 employees expect to see the same.

In shaping wage and compensation policies, two factors stand out globally: workers' productivity and performance (cited by 77% of respondents) and competing to retain talent (cited by 71%) (Figure

4.11). Sector-wise, only six industries expect an emphasis on competition for talent over productivity and performance as a factor in their wage considerations: Electronics, Insurance and Pensions Management, Professional Services, Real Estate, Medical and Healthcare Services, and Government and Public Sector. All other industries anticipate a focus on productivity as the more crucial factor when designing wage strategies over the 2025-2030 period.

{58}------------------------------------------------

Geographically, surveyed companies operating in 32 economies highlight wage alignment with productivity and performance as the key factor, while respondents in 28 economies indicate a greater focus on competition for talent when

determining wage strategies. Wage inequalities (cited by 33% of respondents), government regulations and collective bargaining (32%), and cost reduction strategies (30%) are also influencing compensation decisions globally.

### Wage premium for skills and experience

In collaboration with ADP Research

Given shifting global workforce dynamics, how are differences in education, training and experience reflected in wages? Analysis conducted by ADP Research for the Future of Jobs Report 2025 addresses this question by analysing monthly wage data of workers in the United States according to Occupation Information Network (O\*NET) job zones. The O\*NET data assigns all occupations to job zones, from entry-level positions needing minimal preparation (Job zone 1) to highly specialized roles with extensive preparation, usually demanding graduate school education and extensive job training and work experience (Job zone 5). The research analyses wages at each job zone to calculate a wage premium from one level of workforce preparedness to another.

Workers' median and mean wages increase as the job zone level increases (Figure B4.2A). On average, the median wage is 37% higher for each job zone level (Figure B4.2B). The highest gap between levels is 48%, which is the difference in median wage between job zone 3, where workers

such as Security Guards and Dental Laboratory Technicians usually receive vocational training or an associate degree, and job zone 4, where workers have considerable preparation for the job. The lowest median wage premium gap is 27%, between job zone 4 and job zone 5, which is made up of primarily specialized roles that require extensive training, such as Pharmacists, Lawyers and Biologists.

The mean wage premium is higher, averaging 58% per job zone level, with the marginal premium spiking the jump from jobs requiring considerable preparation, such as Real Estate Brokers and Sales Managers, to specialized roles with extensive preparation, the highest level.

The gap between the median and mean wage premium – the two curves in Figures B4.2A and B – indicates that there exists a wide pay range within the same job zone, and that wider pay ranges are more prevalent for workers in more specialized roles.

Assessing the wage premium for skills through a gender lens reveals that men tend to have a higher wage premium across all zone transitions except one. Men, on average, experience a 44% wage premium between job zones, whereas women see a 30% premium (Figure B4.3).

Gender disparities are most pronounced at specific transitions. While male workers receive a wage premium of 39% at the point of transition

from jobs that require little preparation to jobs that require some preparation, the equivalent wage premium for female workers is only 19%. At the upper end of the job complexity spectrum, women only receive a 15% higher wage for working in specialized jobs that require extensive preparation compared to jobs that require considerable preparation. This contrasts sharply with a 44% higher median wage at this transition point for men.

## Approaches to skills assessment

Removing academic degree requirements and conducting skill-based hiring is an increasingly recognized approach to expanding talent availability.<sup>45</sup> As shown in Figure 4.12, work experience continues to be the most common assessment mechanism in hiring processes, with 81% of businesses expecting to continue to rely on it over the 2025-2030 period. This is consistent with previous editions of the report, underlining the value employers place on practical, on-the-job learning and achievements. Only 4% of companies report that they do not assess the skills of prospective employees, highlighting that skills evaluation is almost universal across industries.

The second most common method of evaluation is skills assessments, expected to be utilized by 48% of employers, highlighting a growing emphasis on directly testing candidates' competencies rather than relying solely on their resumes. In addition,

psychometric tests are planned to be used by 34% of businesses, reflecting an increased focus on evaluating candidates' behavioural traits, cognitive abilities and cultural fit.

The requirement of a university degree features in third place of employers' approaches to skills assessment, with 43% of respondents expecting to continue to use degrees as a requirement by 2030. Comparison with the previous edition of this report shows that employers are increasingly focusing on work experience and psychometric testing over traditional credentials like university degrees. This shift signals a growing recognition that practical skills and cognitive abilities may be more indicative of future job performance than formal educational qualifications, in addition to expanding the talent pool. O\*NET's database of job experience requirements reveals that 14 of the 15 fastest-growing jobs over 2025 to 2030 primarily require a university degree, while only seven of the 15 largest-growing roles demand an advanced degree. This reliance on traditional credentials in rapidly

{61}------------------------------------------------

expanding roles could exacerbate talent shortages. Adopting a skills-first approach can broaden talent pools and strengthen talent pipelines for these future roles.<sup>46</sup> Moreover, the diverse requirements of the largest-growing jobs highlight the critical role of occupations that are often accessible through vocational training, apprenticeships, on-the-job experience, or associate degrees.

However, the expected use of apprenticeships, short courses and online certificates in skills assessment has seen a slight decline since the

report's 2023 edition: 17% of employers anticipate prioritizing apprenticeships while 14% plan to consider online certificates in their hiring decisions.

## Workforce strategies in response to AI adoption

The Future of Jobs Survey finds that 86% of employers expect AI and information processing technologies to transform their business by 2030. In the Financial Services (97%) and Electronics (95%) sectors, anticipated AI exposure is notably higher than the global average. By contrast, employers in sectors such as Energy Technology and Utilities (72%) and Government and Public Sector (76%) expect lower exposure to AI disruption by 2030. Larger organizations are considering it more likely that their business model will be transformed by AI: only 6% of companies with over 50,000 employees expect low AI exposure by 2030, compared to 16% of companies with fewer than 1,000 employees and 15% of those with 1,000-5,000 employees.

Complementing the Future of Jobs Survey, the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey captures insights from more than 11,000 executives

worldwide. Regarding barriers to AI adoption, as presented in Figure 4.13, half of executives worldwide highlight a lack of skills to support adoption as the top barrier. This is closely followed by a lack of vision among managers and leaders (43%). Other obstacles include high costs of AI products and services (29%), lack of customization to local business needs (24%), complex regulations around AI and data usage (21%), and limited consumer demand (16%). Overall, these results point to a persistent gap in skills required for AI adoption, both for managers and workers.

In response to expected AI disruption, reskilling and upskilling of the existing workforce to work more effectively alongside AI emerges as the most anticipated workforce strategy for companies headquartered in 45 out of the 55 economies covered by the report. By 2030, 77% of surveyed employers plan to implement this strategy (Figure 4.14).

In addition, 69% of respondents plan to recruit talent skilled in AI tool design and enhancement,

{62}------------------------------------------------

and 62% anticipate focusing on hiring individuals with skills to work with AI. Almost half of organizations are expecting to reorient their business models toward new AI-driven opportunities (49%), while 47% plan to transition

employees from AI-disrupted roles to other positions. While most employers plan to hire new people with AI relevant skills, a significant share (41%) also expect to downsize their workforce as AI capabilities to replicate roles expand.

### BOX 4.3 Relative AI job and skill concentration, by industry

In collaboration with LinkedIn

Analysis conducted by LinkedIn for the Future of Jobs Report 2025 assesses the relative AI job and skill concentration for 10 industries. This data is calculated by assessing the number of AI occupations and the number of LinkedIn members with at least two reported AI-related skills for each industry. As shown in Figure B4.4, to enable industry comparisons, each sector's AI concentration is benchmarked against the 2016 value of the industry with the highest AI concentration in 2016 (Education).

This analysis helps illustrate which industries have seen the greatest AI uptake, in terms of AI-related jobs and skills as well as AI concentration trends over time. While AI concentration has at least doubled across nearly all industries since 2016, the relative ranking of industries has stayed largely stable. Over the last five years, the order of industries with the highest AI concentration has remained unchanged.

# Region, economy and industry insights

The impact of macrotrends on labour markets over the 2025-2030 period will have both common and sector- and region/economy-specific characteristics across industries and geographies around the world. This chapter highlights key findings from the Future of Jobs Survey as they relate to the expected jobs landscape, anticipated skills needs and planned workforce strategies of employers at regional, economy and industry levels – and offers insights into how businesses in specific economies

and sectors are navigating these transformations.

In addition to the insights presented in this chapter, Part 2 of the report provides detailed region, economy and industry profiles for all geographies and sectors featured in the report, and the corresponding data may also be accessed online, via an interactive data explorer tool, at: <https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-futureof-jobs-report-2025/future-of-jobs-data-explorer-2025>.

## 5.1 Region and economy insights

### Eastern Asia and Oceania

Companies headquartered in **Eastern Asia** expect aging and declining working-age populations and slower economic growth to transform the region's labour markets by 2030. Organizational culture and resistance to change are perceived as a significant barrier to business transformation by 64% of employers in the region, above the global average of 46%. Industry talent shortages are likewise seen as a key barrier to transformation by 53% of companies. To address these challenges, businesses operating in China and Republic of Korea are investing in technologies to automate and augment their workforce, while those operating in Japan and Hong Kong SAR, China, are increasingly tapping into diverse talent pools.

Over the next five years, more than half of companies operating in **China** expect geoeconomic fragmentation and increased efforts in climate mitigation to shape their businesses, above a global average of 34% and 47%, respectively. More than 90% of employers identify AI and robotics as key technologies to transform their organization, while 43% identify new materials and 19% identify biotechnology, a higher share than their global peers (30% and 11%, respectively). Industry talent shortages are highlighted by 38% of businesses operating in the country. According to more than half of employers, government's funding for reskilling and upskilling and increased flexibility on hiring and firing practices could contribute to

increase talent availability, while only 9% expect to see benefits from increased public support for caregivers.

In **Hong Kong SAR, China**, 60% of businesses include increased focus on labour and social issues among the top trends impacting their organization, which is significantly higher than the global average of 46%. This is followed by broadening digital access (60%) and increased climate-mitigation efforts (56%). Technology is seen as central to workforce planning, with 76% of companies aiming to augment their workforce using new technologies. Businesses operating in Hong Kong SAR, China expect 43% of tasks to be completed primarily by technology by 2030, surpassing the global estimate of 34%. Efforts to broaden hiring are evident, as 76% of employers plan to tap into diverse talent pools, compared to 47% globally. Moreover, 82% of businesses are planning to implement targeted recruitment, retention, and progression initiatives, exceeding the global average of 48%.

Overall, 69% of employers in **Japan** highlight ageing and declining working-age populations as a critical trend impacting their organization by 2030, exceeding the global average of 40%. According to 55% of respondents, cultural resistance to change remains a barrier to business transformation, alongside skills gaps (41%) and industry talent shortages (49%). Information Security Analysts and Data Analysts and Scientists are projected to be among the top growing jobs in the country. In response, businesses operating in the country are planning to prioritize access to diverse talent

and supporting reskilling. Employers also share expectations for greater government involvement in provisioning and funding of reskilling and upskilling.

Geoeconomic fragmentation and advances in frontier technologies are likely to drive labour-market transformation in **Republic of Korea** in the next five years: 71% of companies operating in the country highlight increased geopolitical tensions as a key trend impacting their business, more than twice the global average, and 53% mention increased restrictions to global trade. Businesses in Republic of Korea are ahead of global peers in technologies such as semiconductors and new materials. Talent shortages at the industry level are a concern for 47% of respondents. Companies are planning on addressing skills gaps by hiring staff with emerging skills (92%) and adopting technologies to augment the workforce (83%). Additionally, employers operating in Republic of Korea plan to explore workforce strategies such as supplementing childcare for working parents (50%) to attract and retain talent.

Businesses operating in **Australia** foresee a complex mix of technological, green and demographic transitions, as well as geoeconomic fragmentation: 65% of employers identify skills gaps, while 45% view inability to attract talent to the industry as a key business challenge over the 2025-2030 period. To address the increasing need for skilled talent, 45% of respondents hope for changes to immigration policies to attract global talent, compared to a global average of 26%. Additionally, 49% of businesses operating in Australia anticipate

offering cross-border remote work options, nearly double the global average, and 63% identify tapping into diverse talent pools as an effective approach to increasing talent availability in the country.

## South-Eastern Asia

Advances in technology, uncertain economic outlook and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation are foreseen to be shaping labour markets in **South-Eastern Asia** over the 2025-2030 period. To prepare for these disruptions and meet emerging business needs, employers headquartered in the region are particularly focused on upskilling their workforce (96%, compared to 85% globally) and hiring staff with new skills (86%, compared to 70% globally), with a large number of businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines also expecting to address these challenges by facilitating internal job transitions. Finding skilled talent continues to be seen as a main barrier to business transformation, with employers in Singapore and Viet Nam, in particular, calling for policy reforms to expand the talent base in these countries.

Digitalization is perceived as the most important driver of labour-market transformation in **Indonesia** by 2030, with 83% of businesses operating in the country expecting this trend to impact their organization, compared to 60% globally. Forty-one percent of employers also highlight increased restrictions on trade and investment as a key trend impacting their businesses, which is almost

{66}------------------------------------------------

twice the global average. A higher share than global peers aim to leverage new materials and composites (52%) as well as sensing, laser and optical technologies (39%).

## 5.2 Industry insights

### Cross-industry trends and scope for collaboration

The anticipated impact of macrotrends on the future of jobs is multi-faceted across both geographies and sectors. Specific industries are seeing points of convergence as well as distinct barriers to transformation and thus are prioritizing different workforce strategies in response to labour-market transformation by 2030. While 19 out of 22 global industries covered by the report identify skills gaps in the local labour market as the top barrier to industry transformation, each sector also anticipates distinct additional challenges in

the next five years. In both the Government and Public sector and Medical and Healthcare sector, for example, organizational culture and resistance to change features as the most-selected barrier to transformation. In the Real Estate sector, inability to attract talent to the industry is seen as the key obstacle. Four sectors – Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing; Information and Technology Services; Oil and Gas; and Retail and Wholesale of Consumer Goods – view data and technical infrastructure as one of the key barriers. As shown in Figure 5.1, most industries see talent attractiveness at the industry level as a bigger issue than at the firm level over the 2025-2030 period (with Automotive and Aerospace, Education and Training, and Information Technology being the three exceptions).

**Attracting talent to the firm and to the industry**

Share of employers surveyed expecting an inability to attract talent to their firm or an inability to attract talent to their industry will hinder their organizational transformation, by industry.

![](f68421f5d184c116a7061977a9057e63_img.jpg)

Figure 5.1 is a dot plot illustrating the share of employers surveyed expecting an inability to attract talent to their firm or an inability to attract talent to their industry will hinder their organizational transformation, by industry.

The plot compares two metrics for each industry:

- Inability to attract talent to the firm (Left side).
- Inability to attract talent to the industry (Right side).

The color of the dots indicates which challenge is perceived as greater, based on the comparison of the two percentages for that industry.

Legend:

- Dark Blue Dot: Firm attractiveness seen as outweighing industry attractiveness (or equal). This occurs when Inability to attract talent to the firm is less than or equal to Inability to attract talent to the industry (Firm % <= Industry %).
- Light Blue Dot: Industry attractiveness seen as outweighing firm attractiveness. This occurs when Inability to attract talent to the firm is greater than Inability to attract talent to the industry (Firm % > Industry %).
- Share Size: 60 (largest dot) and 12 (smallest dot).

Data Table:

**Note**

Industries in which a larger or equal proportion of companies identify firm-level talent attraction as a greater challenge than industry-level talent attraction are displayed in dark blue. Industries in which industry-level talent attraction is identified as a greater challenge than firm-level talent attraction are displayed in light blue.

The fact that Future of Jobs Survey respondents predominantly evaluate talent availability challenges as industry-level issues points to potentially untapped opportunities for industry stakeholders to collaborate and implement customized intra-industry or cross-industry solutions. However, employers across industries often exhibit different preferences over workforce strategies.

Reaching close to a consensus view, upskilling is selected as the top workforce strategy in 20 industries and ranks second in the remaining two: Electronics and Insurance and Pensions Management. Oil and Gas (96%) and Telecommunications (96%) are the industries most committed to upskilling, while a still significant 73% of Education and Training industry employers plan to focus on this strategy.

There exist more notable industry differences with regard to anticipated use of technologies to either fully automate processes and tasks or complement and augment the human workforce, as shown in Figure 5.2. While most industries aim

to pursue a balance of both automation-focused and augmentation-focused workforce strategies over the 2025-2030 period, 87% of respondents in Electronics expect to focus on automating tasks, whereas only 48% plan to focus on workforce augmentation. Industries including Insurance and Pensions as well as Telecommunications exhibit a similar automation-to-augmentation gap. By contrast, sectors such as Healthcare, Agriculture, and Government report a higher preference for augmentation over automation.

Additionally, while hiring staff with new skills to meet emerging business needs features among the top three workforce strategies in 17 out of 22 sectors – possibly precipitating strong intra- and inter-industry competition over talent over the next five years – upskilling and transitioning existing staff from declining to growing job roles appears as an untapped opportunity: only the Automotive and Aerospace, Electronics, and Real Estate sectors currently aim to prioritize such job transitions as one of their top three workforce strategies by 2030.

## Industry-level findings

By 2030, transformation of the **Accommodation, Food, and Leisure** industry is expected to be shaped by rising cost of living and a greater focus on labour and social issues. Increased digitalization – while still relevant for a significant 51% of respondents – appears as less central than in other industries. The focus placed by the industry on human experience and social issues is reflected in the human-technology frontier, as companies anticipate continued reliance on humans to predominantly deliver 43% of total work tasks over the next five years, higher than the global industry average. However, talent availability is a growing concern, with 59% of employers expecting hiring challenges to worsen. To respond to these emerging trends, firms are scaling up upskilling efforts, hiring for emerging skills and augmenting workforce with new technologies, while also aiming to improve the industry's attractiveness by supporting employee health and well-being, improving wages and talent progression. About one third of companies is investing in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, focusing particularly on young talent (69%, compared to the 52% global industry average) and migrant workers (33%, compared to 20% globally).

The **Advanced Manufacturing** sector expects to undergo transformation shaped by increased investments to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change and rising cost of living. Companies are anticipating the adoption of AI (81%), robotics (69%), and new materials and

composites (63%, almost twice as many as in other industries). The industry predicts increasing demand for AI and big data skills, creative thinking, networks and cybersecurity skills, but also systems thinking, design and user experience, and resource management. To prepare for these changes, employers expect to be able to upskill 29% of workers in their current role, while they foresee a need for 15% of workers to be reskilled and re-deployed in the next five years. Fifty percent of firms are planning to tap into diverse talent pools to ease labour shortages, and 55% (more than in most other industries) plan to focus their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on workers aged 55 years and above.

Skills gaps are seen as the key barrier to transformation for businesses in the **Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing** industry by 2030 (selected by 68% of respondents), followed by outdated regulations (51%, compared to the 39% global industry average) and insufficient data infrastructure (46%, compared to 32% globally). Climate mitigation and adaptation are key challenges highlighted by the industry, alongside rising cost of living. As employers address these challenges, they are planning to upgrade their workforce strategies by emphasizing upskilling and reskilling, hiring for new skills, and augmenting their workforce with technology. The top three skills on the rise are predicted to be resilience, flexibility and agility, technological literacy, and environmental stewardship, while skills related to AI and big data, networks, and cybersecurity are growing more slowly than in other industries. One-third of firms in the industry do not have a diversity, equity and

inclusion programme, while 63% expect wages to account for a growing share of employers' total revenues, with 92% intending to align wages with productivity and 46% aiming to reduce wage inequalities.

The **Automotive and Aerospace** sector stands out for its expectation regarding the significant impact that both climate mitigation and geoeconomic fragmentation might have on the industry in the next five years: 54% of respondents identify rising geopolitical tensions (compared to 34% across other industries) and 46% highlight increasing trade restrictions (compared to 23% in other industries) as key drivers of change. About one-fourth of industry players are evaluating options to reshore, nearshore or friendshore, and 16% to offshore – suggesting the possibility of greater supply chain re-organization than in other industries. These trends point to considerable transformation for most companies, with skills gaps in labour markets, organizational cultures and resistance to change identified as top barriers, alongside difficulties to attract talent to the industry (highlighted by 42% of respondents, compared to 37% in other industries) and limited access to investment capital (40%, compared to 26% in other industries). Employers are prioritizing workforce strategies that focus on upskilling, automating processes, and transitioning staff from declining to growing roles. Jobs on the rise are predicted to include Robotics Engineers and Data Analysts and Scientists.

In the **Chemical and Advanced Materials** sector, industry transformation is foreseen to be heavily influenced by investments in the green and digital transitions, leading to a projected increase in job roles for AI and Machine Learning Specialists and Business Development Professionals by 2030. The industry also anticipates a need for more AI and big data as well as environmental stewardship skills. However, the human factor is expected to pose a significant barrier for the industry, with skills gaps in the labour markets and talent attraction to the industry identified as the top two obstacles to industry transformation. To improve industry attractiveness, companies are planning to focus on talent progression and promotion processes, supporting employees' health and well-being and offering higher wages. Employers suggest governments should support upskilling and reskilling and improve education systems, as well as provide wage subsidies and greater flexibility in wage setting. Nine in 10 companies in the industry plan to align wages closely with productivity while only 9% plan to review wage costs as part of cost-reduction exercises in the next five years.

Broadening digital access, increased focus on labour and social issues, and slower economic growth are expected to drive the transformation of the **Education and Training** sector by 2030. AI and big data skills as well as creative thinking are foreseen to grow in importance. Emerging job roles within the industry are anticipated to include AI and Machine Learning Specialists and

Digital Transformation Specialists. Employers also place greater emphasis than in other industries on curiosity and lifelong learning, marketing and media skills and multilingualism. The industry is less focused than other sectors on upskilling and reskilling its own workforce (73%, compared to the 85% global industry average), while employers aim to improve attractiveness through better talent progression and promotion processes, higher wages, and supporting employee well-being.

By 2030, the landscape of the **Electronics** sector is expected to be shaped by increased climate mitigation efforts, continued digitalization of the economy, and aging and shrinking workforces, while the industry appears less concerned about economic cycles: only 25% of respondents anticipate significant impact from slower economic growth, compared to 42% across all sectors. With AI, robotics and energy technologies targeted for adoption, industry job growth is predicted for AI and Machine Learning Specialists and Electrotechnology Engineers. Talent availability is seen as a concern, with 61% of employers expecting hiring challenges to worsen but only 9% worried about talent retention (compared to 19% global industry average). Workforce strategies are planned to focus on automation, upskilling, and transitioning staff to growing roles. Other than public policy support on reskilling and upskilling, firms also call for improved transport infrastructure to enhance talent availability.

Over the next five years, climate mitigation is foreseen to be at the centre of the **Energy Technology and Utilities** sector, as companies plan to invest in greener technologies for energy generation, storage and distribution. As a result, Environmental Engineers, AI and Machine Learning Specialists and Renewable Energy Engineers are among the expected top-growing job roles in the sector. As employers aim to transform their business, industry players are particularly concerned about skills gaps in the labour market (81%, compared to 63% across all industries), alongside outdated or inflexible regulations (44%), organizational culture and resistance to change, and the industry's capacity to attract talent (37%). To improve talent availability and industry attractiveness, businesses are planning on improving talent progression and promotion processes and investing in reskilling and upskilling programmes, for which respondents see a role for increased financial support from the public sector.

Increased digitalization is seen as the primary driver of transformation in the **Financial Services and Capital Markets** sector over the next five years, alongside adaptation to climate change and slower economic growth. The sector also anticipates being particularly exposed to AI, with only 5% of employers expecting no significant adoption of the technology by 2030 (compared to 14% across all industries). As a result, AI and big data skills, technological literacy and cybersecurity skills are estimated to be in high demand and the industry anticipates creation of new job roles for

{85}------------------------------------------------

Big Data Specialists, AI and Machine Learning Specialists, and Security Management Specialists. To improve talent availability, the industry is planning on investing in reskilling and upskilling (71% of employers), supporting employees' well-being (64%) and improving promotion processes (61%). Remote and hybrid work is also seen as a strategy to stay attractive for 58% of companies in the industry, and one out of two respondents is calling for changes to labour laws that support remote work (compared to 36% in other sectors). The industry is particularly advanced in its plans to remove degree requirements in favour of skills-based hiring approaches (28%, compared to 19% across all industries).

Employers in the **Government and Public Sector** identify organizational culture and resistance to change as the top barrier to transformation by 2030, as the sector plans to continue investing in digital and green transformation over the next five years. In line with global trends, AI and big data, Networks and cybersecurity and Technological literacy are the skills with highest perceived increasing importance, followed by Environmental stewardship and creative thinking skills. Skills gaps in the labour market and outdated regulatory frameworks are seen as potentially slowing down transformation of the sector. Overall, public employers are positive about future talent availability, with 52% of respondents expecting improvements in the next five years. To increase sector attractiveness and strengthen the sector talent base, 80% of employers are planning

on enhancing talent progression and providing reskilling and upskilling programmes in the next five years.

**Information and Technology Services** companies are heavily focused on adopting advanced technologies by 2030, with anticipated near-universal uptake of AI and information processing (99%, compared to the 86% global industry average) and a strong focus also on quantum and encryption technologies (41%, compared to 12% globally). Growing job roles in the sector are foreseen to include Digital Transformation Specialists, Software and Applications Developers, and Sales and Marketing Professionals. Alongside AI and cybersecurity skills, the industry expects stronger emphasis on resilience, flexibility, and agility than most other sectors, while more employers expect demand for programming and design and user experience skills to decline than in other industries. Workforce strategies aim to prioritize upskilling and hiring talent with new skills to address emerging needs, alongside a higher tendency to reduce staff with less relevant skills (49%, compared to 41% in other industries) and offshore segments of the workforce (17%, compared to 8%).

By 2030, transformation of the **Infrastructure** sector is foreseen to be driven by a need to increase investments in carbon reduction, climate adaptation and digitalization. As a result, new job roles are expected to be created for Big Data Specialists and Organizational Development

World Economic Forum, Future of Jobs Survey 2024.

{93}------------------------------------------------

# Conclusions

The transformation of the jobs and skills landscape anticipated by this year's Future of Jobs Survey respondents will have significant impacts on businesses, industries, governments and workers worldwide. It is crucial to develop nuanced forecasts, identify appropriate workforce and talent strategies, and make informed decisions on managing disruptions to jobs and skills for employers and workers alike.

This edition of the *Future of Jobs Report* presents a mixed picture with regard to the 2025-2030 outlook for the global labour market. On the one hand, amid newly emerging drivers such as increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, rising cost of living and the widespread adoption of AI tools in the workforce, global macrotrends create an ever-more complex environment for policy-makers, employers and workers to navigate, and uncertainty remains high. On the other hand, the report finds a strongly net-positive global employment outlook, with a continuing decrease in the rate of skills obsolescence, as reskilling, upskilling and redeployment initiatives implemented in recent years begin to register in the data and materialize their global workforce impact.

Employers across all industries and geographies demonstrate greater awareness and willingness than in previous editions of the report to proactively engage in addressing workforce and talent challenges, and to do so by pragmatically leveraging innovative approaches such as skills-based hiring policies and a more strategic focus on diversity, equity and inclusion.

However, skills gaps remain the predominant barrier to transformation across most industries and economies, and this year's edition of the *Future of Jobs Report* captures some early signals of likely future priority areas for constructive multistakeholder engagement, including a need for proactive and dynamic job transitions across a wider and growing range of job roles and questions concerning the appropriate future balance between deeper automation and broader augmentation.

This last point reflects a core tenet of the *Future of Jobs Report* since its inception: that the future of work can be shaped for better outcomes and that it is the policy, business and investment decisions made by leaders today that will determine these outcomes and the future space for action. The World Economic Forum is actively supporting the building of a future-ready, inclusive workforce through its two human capital flagship initiatives: [The Reskilling Revolution](#) and [The Jobs Initiative](#). We hope that this report will contribute to an ambitious multistakeholder agenda to better prepare workers, businesses, governments, educators and civil society, empowering them to build a better future of jobs for all.

# Appendix: Report Methodology

This report is based on an analysis of the results of the edition of an extensive survey of Chief People, Chief Learning Officers, Chief Strategy Offices and Chief Executive Officers of leading global employers. Established in 2015, the Future of Jobs Survey has been instrumental in providing insights into the evolution of jobs and skills and the future labour market. It is a pioneering measurement tool that enables companies and governments to map their workforce planning for the next five years. Survey data is collected across economies and industries, providing a compass for private- and public-sector leaders who strive to ensure a better future of work for all.

## Survey design

The Future of Jobs Survey 2024 builds on the methodology from the previous survey editions. Following survey best practices and informed by literature review, several questions were refined and new questions were added.

The survey consists of five interrelated parts. **Business Trends 2024-2030** focuses on the macrotrends and technology adoption. It also examines the organizations' transformation barriers. **Occupation Trends 2024-2030** identifies the roles and how these are expected to evolve up until 2030. It also studies how the macrotrends and technology trends contribute to the job growth and decline. **Skill Trends 2024-2030** analyses the skills in demand and collects information on training programmes and employee reskilling needs and efforts. **Workforce Practices 2024-2030** explores the talent strategies and talent-management practices in organizations. **People and Technology** assesses the automation and augmentation level at the job and task level, as well as companies' approach to enabling people and technology working together.

The survey is comprised of 38 questions and was made available in 12 languages: Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese (simplified), French, Hebrew, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish and Vietnamese. The survey collection process was conducted via Qualtrics, with data collection spanning a four-month period from May to September 2024.

## Representativeness

The survey set out to represent the current strategies, projections and estimates of global businesses, with a focus on large multinational companies and more localized companies which are of significance due to their employee or revenue size. As such, there are two areas of the future of jobs that remain out of scope for this report: the future of jobs as it relates to the activities of small enterprises and as it relates to the informal sector.

The Future of Jobs Survey was distributed through collaboration between the World Economic Forum and its regional survey partners, amplified by the World Economic Forum's extensive network and its constituents. The survey is also the result of cross-departmental coordination within the World Economic Forum. The Forum's Global Industries Team supported the report team's efforts to collect relevant samples. For key partners in the survey distribution process, please refer to both the Survey Partners and Acknowledgements sections.

Detailed sample design specifications were shared with survey partners, requesting that the sample of companies targeted for participation in the survey should be drawn from a cross-section of leading companies that make up an economy or region's economy. The target companies were specified as the largest multinational and national companies, significant in terms of revenue or employee size. The threshold was set at companies with 500 employees or more as questions concerning job and skill outlook are most relevant for larger companies with a significant share of employment.

The final sub-selection of economies with data of sufficient quality to be featured in the report was based on the overall number of responses from companies with a presence in each economy. The survey has arrived at a sample in which more than half of the companies surveyed operate in more than one economy, and a reasonable range of companies maintained a focused local or regional presence. The final sub-selection of industries was included based on the overall number of responses by industry, in addition to a qualitative review of the pool of named companies represented in the survey data. The final sub-selection of regions and income groups was included based on the headquarter locations of the companies.

{97}------------------------------------------------

After relevant criteria were applied, the sample was found to be composed of 22 industry clusters and 55 economies. Industry clusters include: Accommodation, Food, and Leisure; Advanced Manufacturing; Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing; Automotive and Aerospace; Chemical and Advanced Materials; Education and Training; Electronics; Energy Technology and Utilities; Financial Services and Capital Markets; Government and Public Sector; Information and Technology Services; Infrastructure; Insurance and Pensions Management; Medical and Healthcare Services; Mining and Metals; Oil and Gas; Production of Consumer Goods; Professional Services; Real Estate; Retail and Wholesale of Consumer Goods; Supply Chain and Transportation; and Telecommunications. Refer to Table A1 for the list of industry clusters. Economies include Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Czechia, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong SAR, China, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. Collectively, these economies represent 88% of global GDP.

In total, the report's dataset contains 1,043 unique responses by global companies, collectively representing more than 14.1 million employees worldwide.

## Classification frameworks for jobs and skills

This year's report employed the Occupational Information Network (O\*NET) framework, cross-walked with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). O\*NET was developed by the US Department of Labour in collaboration with its Bureau of Labour Statistics' Standard Classification of Occupations (SOC) and remains the most extensive and respected classification of its kind. ISCO is a classification system developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) to organize information on jobs and labour. It is a part of the UN's classification system for social and economic purposes. The list of roles used in the report has been enhanced with roles which were consistently added to previous editions of the report and refer to the emerging roles from data partner collaborations.

Both the Future of Jobs survey and the Future of Jobs report use the World Economic Forum's Global Skills Taxonomy to categorize skills (Table A2). Built on a foundation of data insights and ongoing inputs from our network of partners, the taxonomy focuses on the skills that are needed by workers across sectors and regions in a fast-changing labour market. It is designed to serve as a "universal adapter" between data presented in the language of the many region and industry specific skills taxonomies in use. You may view the Global Skills Taxonomy on the [Reskilling Revolution webpage](#). New data from the Future of Jobs Survey is presented in Chapter 3.

## Metrics

Statistical samples presented in this report correspond to organizations' self-reported economies and industries of operation. Each organization which responded to the Future of Jobs Survey was permitted to associate itself with up to 10 economies and up to three industries of operation.

Most metrics presented in this report are shares of respondents identifying their organization with a business strategy/impact or the mean value of a metric relating to business operations which was directly estimated by respondents. A small number of metrics relating to labour markets and skills are derived from information provided in different formats. These are described below.

## Net growth in employment and labour-market churn

This edition of the Future of Jobs Report continues to estimate growth and labour-market churn in the next five years. Net growth represents the forecast increase or decrease in the size of a workforce, either as a fraction of its current size, or in millions of employees. Labour-market churn represents the sum of job losses and created jobs in a workforce as a fraction of its initial size. In this report both

concepts are applied to roles in the jobs taxonomy (see Table A3) and industries in the industry taxonomy (see Table A1). The figures correspond to changes forecast by survey respondents for a five-year period between 2025 and 2030, with the survey being administered from May to August 2024. Metrics relating to both concepts reflect forecast structural changes in employment across

{99}------------------------------------------------

companies, economies, industries and roles. Turnover induced by employees moving between jobs for personal reasons is not included.

## Fractional metrics

Respondents aggregated roles included in the jobs taxonomy to six groups:

- Main roles in the organization with a growing employment outlook for the next five years
- Main roles in the organization with a declining employment outlook for the next five years
- Main roles in the organization with a stable employment outlook for the next five years
- Roles that are relatively small presently but strategically important and with a growing employment outlook for the next five years

Respondents allocated up to five roles from the jobs taxonomy to each of the four groups. One of the five roles in the presently relatively small but strategically important and with a growing employment outlook could be specified by a free-text field. Free-text fields were subsequently allocated to jobs in the jobs taxonomy where possible. Metrics on roles are only published in the report when they meet statistical criteria in a given sample.

Respondents subsequently allocated workforce fractions to each of the above groups of jobs at present, and estimated the growth and decline of the main roles with growing outlook, main roles with declining outlook, and relatively small roles presently with growing outlook. These workforce fractions were used to calculate two metrics: estimated net growth between 2025 and 2030 and estimated structural labour-market churn from 2025 to 2030, for the labour forces pertaining to roles in the jobs taxonomy. In the calculation of net growth, for a specific role, a simple mean of the growth and decline was first calculated based on projection from the respondents who have selected this role, while the growth of the roles identified as stable outlook is zero. The net growth draws on weighted averages of the growth and decline weighted on the number of respondents who consider this role as growing and stable, with the numerator reflecting the weighted shares of anticipated workforce increases and decreases and the denominator aggregating total workforce shares across all anticipated states (growing, declining and stable). The churn metric, similarly, adopts absolute values for workforce decreases. These methodologies aim to present an objective, scalable perspective on workforce transformations at the role and industry level.

## Reweighted metrics

International Labour Organization (ILO) data were then used to translate the forecast fractional net growth for each role into estimates of the number of jobs that will be created or displaced between 2025 and 2030. ILO estimates of the number of employees in each occupational category of ISCO08 level 2 were used as a basis for the number of employees working at the time of publication. To account for the absence of China-specific data in the ILO's employment-by-occupation dataset, a China employment multiplier was calculated based on the share of China's employment figure in global employment figure and applied under the assumption that China's labour market structure aligns with global patterns. To approximate the number of employees in each occupation of the jobs taxonomy used in the Future of Jobs Survey, the jobs taxonomy (a modified and extended version of the O\*NET SOC occupational classification) was mapped to the ISCO08 occupational taxonomy used in the ILO data by modifying and extending the map developed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which connects SOC level 4 and ISCO08 level 4. Estimates of present employment were then multiplied by the fractional net growth estimates obtained from the survey, to estimate net growth worldwide in units of millions of employees.

Using this method, the Future of Jobs dataset described in Chapter 2 corresponds to 1.18 billion employees. By comparison, the ILO dataset used in the analysis accounts for 2.18 billion employees, and 2.76 billion employees upon applying the China multiplier. The remaining 1.58 billion employees correspond to roles for which the Future of Jobs Survey did not collect sufficient data to reliably estimate net growth. Data on employees rather than general employment was used as organizations responding to the Future of Jobs Survey maintain workers in formal rather than informal employment.

The estimates of the number of employees per sector which can be found in the Industry Profiles are based on the full dataset of 2.18 billion employees worldwide. This calculation is described in the user guide to the profiles.

## Attribution to jobs

To analyze the impact of specific trends on job growth and decline, survey respondents attributed the growth and decline of roles to macrotrends and technology trends. Respondent's weighted attribution was used to allocate a fraction of job changes to specific trends. These were then mapped to ILO occupation data to calculate the absolute number of jobs created and destroyed per occupation in the next five years.

{100}------------------------------------------------

To limit the potential impact of randomisation inherent in survey data, two techniques were employed: capping the maximum impact of a particular trend-job combination and removing attributions with an insufficient number of respondents. Specifically, the total impact of a

single trend on a job was capped at the 99th percentile of all trend-job combinations, 1.61 million for job increase, and 1st percentile, minus 872 thousand for job loss, and attribution pairs with fewer than three votes were excluded, with their impact categorized as unexplained.

TABLE A2 **Skill taxonomy**

Skills were selected from levels 3 and 4 of the Global Skills Taxonomy to represent skills of interest to organizations across sectors and economies.
