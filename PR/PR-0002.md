## Section 1.1.1 The Rise of AI in the Workplace

### 原文 (Line 165)

> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, exemplified by the emergence of ChatGPT, Claude, and other generative AI tools, has fundamentally transformed the modern workplace. Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, AI-powered tools have been rapidly adopted across industries, enabling employees to automate routine tasks, enhance creative output, and improve decision-making processes. In China, the national "AI+" strategy has further accelerated the integration of AI into organizational processes, positioning AI literacy as an increasingly critical competency for employees in the digital economy.

> The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, exemplified by the emergence of ChatGPT, Claude, and other generative AI tools, has fundamentally transformed the modern workplace. Since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022, AI-powered tools have been rapidly adopted across industries, enabling employees to automate routine tasks, enhance creative output, and improve decision-making processes. **Recent industry data underscores this transformation: 92% of companies plan to increase their AI investments over the next three years (McKinsey, 2025), while 92% of Fortune 500 companies already have employees actively using ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025). Furthermore, over 70% of employees believe that AI will change more than 30% of their work within two years (McKinsey, 2025).** In China, the national "AI+" strategy has further accelerated the integration of AI into organizational processes, positioning AI literacy as an increasingly critical competency for employees in the digital economy.

## Section 1.1.2 Generational Asymmetry in AI Competence

### 原文 (Lines 167-169)

> A distinctive feature of the current AI revolution is the generational asymmetry in technological competence. Generation Z employees, typically defined as those born between 1995 and 2010, have grown up immersed in digital technologies and are often characterized as "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001). Research suggests that younger employees tend to adopt new technologies more quickly and exhibit higher levels of digital fluency compared to their older counterparts (Ng et al., 2023). This creates an interesting power dynamic in organizations: while managers and senior employees typically hold formal authority and institutional knowledge, younger employees may possess superior AI skills that are increasingly valuable in the workplace.

> A distinctive feature of the current AI revolution is the generational asymmetry in technological competence. Generation Z employees, typically defined as those born between 1995 and 2010, have grown up immersed in digital technologies and are often characterized as "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001). Research suggests that younger employees tend to adopt new technologies more quickly and exhibit higher levels of digital fluency compared to their older counterparts (Ng et al., 2023). **Recent survey data reveals that 80% of Gen Z employees (aged 18-24) report feeling comfortable using gen AI at work, significantly higher than older cohorts (McKinsey, 2025). Similarly, Deloitte's 2025 survey of over 23,000 respondents across 44 countries found that 57% of Gen Z employees use generative AI in their daily work, with 70% actively investing time to develop AI-related skills (Deloitte, 2025). **Furthermore, a study by International Workplace Group highlights that Gen Z is playing a pivotal role in cross-generational upskilling, with 59% of Gen Z employees actively coaching older colleagues on how to use AI tools (IWG, 2025).** Interestingly, employees aged 35-44 (core millennials, often in managerial roles) exhibit even higher comfort levels at 90%, suggesting that generational differences may be more nuanced than a simple "digital native" framing implies—both young employees and their direct supervisors often share high AI proficiency, potentially creating opportunities for intergenerational collaboration rather than conflict.** This creates an interesting power dynamic in organizations: while managers and senior employees typically hold formal authority and institutional knowledge, younger employees may possess superior AI skills that are increasingly valuable in the workplace.

## Section 1.1.3 Shifting Power Dynamics

### 原文 (Lines 171-173)

> This generational asymmetry in AI competence has the potential to reshape traditional power dynamics within organizations. According to Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), power in organizations derives from the control of scarce and valuable resources. When Generation Z employees possess AI skills that their supervisors lack, they may acquire a form of resource-based power that enables them to exert upward influence on their managers. This phenomenon challenges conventional top-down leadership models and raises important questions about how AI literacy translates into organizational influence.

> This generational asymmetry in AI competence has the potential to reshape traditional power dynamics within organizations. According to Resource Dependence Theory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), power in organizations derives from the control of scarce and valuable resources. When Generation Z employees possess AI skills that their supervisors lack, they may acquire a form of resource-based power that enables them to exert upward influence on their managers. **Crucially, McKinsey's Superagency research (2025) reveals a significant perception gap: employees are using AI for more than 30% of their daily tasks at a rate 3.25 times higher than their C-suite leaders estimate (13% vs. 4%). This "invisible" adoption creates a form of information asymmetry where subordinates hold resources that supervisors may not even be aware of. Furthermore, while 47% of C-suite executives express frustration that their companies are developing gen AI tools too slowly, 2.4 times more leaders cite 'employee readiness' as an adoption barrier compared to employees themselves—despite employees already using AI at rates far exceeding expectations.** This phenomenon challenges conventional top-down leadership models and raises important questions about how AI literacy translates into organizational influence.

## 修改理由

1. **增强说服力**: 原文论点合理但缺乏具体数据支撑；添加行业报告数据使论点更具实证基础。
2. **引入3.25倍差距精确数据**: "3倍"变为"3.25倍 (13% vs 4%)"，更精确地量化了资源信息不对称。
3. **丰富代际叙事**: 引入35-44岁群体(90%舒适度)数据，使论述从简单的"Z世代优势"深化为更细致的"代际共鸣可能"。
4. **与核心理论对接**: 新增的"invisible adoption"和"information asymmetry"表述直接呼应资源依赖理论框架。
